Corn The Last Rung on the Ladder The Man Who Loved Flowers One for the Road The Woman in the Room By Stephen King Copyright INTRODUCTION I am often given the big smiling handshake at parties which I avoid attending whenever possible by someone who then with an air of gleeful conspiracy will say You know I ve always wanted to write I used to try to be polite These days I reply with the same jubilant excitement You know I ve always wanted to be a brain surgeon They look puzzled It doesn t matter There are a lot of puzzled people wandering around lately If you want to write you write The only way to learn to write is by writing And that would not be a useful approach to brain surgery Stephen King always wanted to write and he writes So he wrote Carrie and Salem s Lot and The Shining and the good short stories you can read in this book and a stupendous number of other stories and books and fragments and poems and essays and other unclassifiable things most of them too wretched to ever publish Because that is the way it is done Because there is no other way to do it Not one other way Compulsive diligence is almost enough But not quite You have to have a taste for words Gluttony You have to want to roll in them You have to read millions of them written by other people You read everything with grinding envy or a weary contempt You save the most contempt for the people who conceal ineptitude with long words Germanic sentence structure obtrusive symbols and no sense of story pace or character Then you have to start knowing yourself so well that you begin to know other people A piece of us is in every person we can ever meet Okay then Stupendous diligence plus word-love plus empathy and out of that can come painfully some objectivity Never total objectivity At this frangible moment in time I am typing these words on my blue machine seven lines down from the top of my page two of this introduction knowing clearly the flavor and meaning I am hunting for but not at all certain I am getting it Having been around twice as long as Stephen King I have a little more objectivity about my work than he has about his It comes so painfully and so slowly You send books out into the world and it is very hard to shuck them out of the spirit They are tangled children trying to make their way in spite of the handicaps you have imposed on them I would give a pretty to get them all back home and take one last good swing at every one of them Page by page Digging and cleaning brushing and furbishing Tidying up Stephen King is a far far better writer at thirty than I was at thirty or at forty I am entitled to hate him a little bit for this And I think I know of a dozen demons hiding in the bushes where his path leads and even if I had a way to warn him it would do no good He whips them or they whip him It is exactly that simple Are we all together so far Diligence word-lust empathy equal growing objectivity and then what Story Story Dammit story Story is something happening to someone you have been led to care about It can happen in any dimension physical mental spiritual and in combinations of those dimensions Without author intrusion Author intrusion is My God Mama look how nice I m writing Another kind of intrusion is a grotesquerie Here is one of my favorites culled from a Big Best Seller of yesteryear His eyes slid down the front of her dress Author intrusion is a phrase so inept the reader suddenly realizes he is reading and he backs out of the story He is shocked back out of the story Another author intrusion is the mini-lecture embedded in the story This is one of my most grievous failings An image can be neatly done be unexpected and not break the spell In a story in this book called Trucks Stephen King is writing about a tense scene of waiting in a truck stop describing the people He was a salesman and he kept his display bag close to him like a pet dog that had gone to sleep I find that neat In another story he demonstrates his good ear the ring of exactness and truth he can give dialogue A man and his wife are on a long trip They are traveling a back road She says Yes Burt I know we re in Nebraska Burt But where the hell are we He says You ve got the road atlas Look it up Or can t you read Nice It looks so simple Just like brain surgery The knife has an edge You hold it so And cut Now at risk of being an iconoclast I will say that I do not give a diddly-whoop what Stephen King chooses as an area in which to write The fact that he presently enjoys writing in the field of spooks and spells and slitherings in the cellar is to me the least important and useful fact about the man anyone can relate There are a lot of slitherings in here and there is a maddened pressing machine that haunts me as it will you and there are enough persuasively evil children to fill Disney World on any Sunday in February but the main thing is story One is led to care Note this Two of the most difficult areas to write in are humor and the occult In clumsy hands the humor turns to dirge and the occult turns funny But once you know how you can write in any area Stephen King is not going to restrict himself to his present field of intense interest One of the most resonant and affecting stories in this book is The Last Rung on the Ladder A gem Nary a rustle nor breath of other worlds in it Final word He does not write to please you He writes to please himself I write to please myself When that happens you will like the work too These stories pleased Stephen King and they pleased me By strange coincidence on the day I write this Stephen King s novel The Shining and my novel Condominium are both on the Best Seller List We are not in competition for your attention with each other We are in competition I suppose with the inept and pretentious and sensational books published by household names who have never really bothered to learn their craft Insofar as story is concerned and pleasure is concerned there are not enough Stephen Kings to go around If you have read this whole thing I hope you have plenty of time You could have been reading the stories JOHN D MACDONALD FOREWORD Let s talk you and I Let s talk about fear The house is empty as I write this a cold February rain is falling outside It s night Sometimes when the wind blows the way it s blowing now we lose the power But for now it s on and so let s talk very honestly about fear Let s talk very rationally about moving to the rim of madness and perhaps over the edge My name is Stephen King I am a grown man with a wife and three children I love them and I believe that the feeling is reciprocated My job is writing and it s a job I like very much The stories Carrie Salem s Lot and The Shining have been successful enough to allow me to write full-time which is an agreeable thing to be able to do At this point in my life I seem to be reasonably healthy In the last year I have been able to reduce my cigarette habit from the unfiltered brand I had smoked since I was eighteen to a low nicotine and tar brand and I still hope to be able to quit completely My family and I live in a pleasant house beside a relatively unpolluted lake in Maine last fall I awoke one morning and saw a deer standing on the back lawn by the picnic table We have a good life Still let s talk about fear We won t raise our voices and we won t scream we ll talk rationally you and I We ll talk about the way the good fabric of things sometimes has a way of unraveling with shocking suddenness At night when I go to bed I still am at pains to be sure that my legs are under the blankets after the lights go out I m not a child anymore but I don t like to sleep with one leg sticking out Because if a cool hand ever reached out from under the bed and grasped my ankle I might scream Yes I might scream to wake the dead That sort of thing doesn t happen of course and we all know that In the stories that follow you will encounter all manner of night creatures vampires demon lovers a thing that lives in the closet all sorts of other terrors None of them are real The thing under my bed waiting to grab my ankle isn t real I know that and I also know that if I m careful to keep my foot under the covers it will never be able to grab my ankle Sometimes I speak before groups of people who are interested in writing or in literature and before the question-and-answer period is over someone always rises and asks this question Why do you choose to write about such gruesome subjects I usually answer this with another question Why do you assume that I have a choice Writing is a catch-as-catch-can sort of occupation All of us seem to come equipped with filters on the floors of our minds and all the filters have differing sizes and meshes What catches in my filter may run right through yours What catches in yours may pass through mine no sweat All of us seem to have a built-in obligation to sift through the sludge that gets caught in our respective mind-filters and what we find there usually develops into some sort of sideline The accountant may also be a photographer The astronomer may collect coins The school-teacher may do gravestone rubbings in charcoal The sludge caught in the mind s filter the stuff that refuses to go through frequently becomes each person s private obsession In civilized society we have an unspoken agreement to call our obsessions hobbies Sometimes the hobby can become a full-time job The accountant may discover that he can make enough money to support his family taking pictures the schoolteacher may become enough of an expert on grave rubbings to go on the lecture circuit And there are some professions which begin as hobbies and remain hobbies even after the practitioner is able to earn his living by pursuing his hobby but because hobby is such a bumpy common-sounding little word we also have an unspoken agreement that we will call our professional hobbies the arts Painting Sculpture Composing Singing Acting The playing of a musical instrument Writing Enough books have been written on these seven subjects alone to sink a fleet of luxury liners And the only thing we seem to be able to agree upon about them is this that those who practice these arts honestly would continue to practice them even if they were not paid for their efforts even if their efforts were criticized or even reviled even on pain of imprisonment or death To me that seems to be a pretty fair definition of obsessional behavior It applies to the plain hobbies as well as the fancy ones we call the arts gun collectors sport bumper stickers reading you will take my gun only when you pry my cold dead fingers from it and in the suburbs of Boston housewives who discovered political activism during the busing furor often sported similar stickers reading you ll TAKE ME TO PRISON BEFORE YOU TAKE MY CHILDREN OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD On the back bumpers of their station wagons Similarly if coin collecting were outlawed tomorrow the astronomer very likely wouldn t turn in his steel pennies and buffalo nickels he d wrap them carefully in plastic sink them to the bottom of his toilet tank and gloat over them after midnight We seem to be wandering away from the subject of fear but we really haven t wandered very far The sludge that catches in the mesh of my drain is often the stuff of fear My obsession is with the macabre I didn t write any of the stories which follow for money although some of them were sold to magazines before they appeared here and I never once returned a check uncashed I may be obsessional but I m not crazy Yet I repeat I didn t write them for money I wrote them because it occurred to me to write them I have a marketable obsession There are madmen and madwomen in padded cells the world over who are not so lucky I am not a great artist but I have always felt impelled to write So each day I sift the sludge anew going through the cast-off bits and pieces of observation of memory of speculation trying to make something out of the stuff that didn t go through the filter and down the drain into the subconscious Louis L Amour the Western writer and I might both stand at the edge of a small pond in Colorado and we both might have an idea at exactly the same time We might both feel the urge to sit down and try to work it out in words His story might be about water rights in a dry season my story would more likely be about some dreadful hulking thing rising out of the still waters to carry off sheep and horses and finally people Louis L Amour s obsession centers on the history of the American West I tend more toward things that slither by starlight He writes Westerns I write fearsomes We re both a little bit nuts The arts are obsessional and obsession is dangerous It s like a knife in the mind In some cases Dylan Thomas comes to mind and Ross Lockridge and Hart Crane and Sylvia Plath the knife can turn savagely upon the person wielding it Art is a localized illness usually benign creative people tend to live a long time sometimes terribly malignant You use the knife carefully because you know it doesn t care who it cuts And if you are wise you sift the sludge carefully because some of that stuff may not be dead After the why do you write that stuff question has been disposed of the companion question comes up Why do people read that stuff What makes it sell This question carries a hidden assumption with it and the assumption is that the story about fear the story about horror is an unhealthy taste People who write me often begin by saying I suppose you will think I m strange but I really liked Salem s Lot or Probably I m morbid but I enjoyed every page of The Shining I think the key to this may lie in a line of movie criticism from Newsweek magazine The review was of a horror film not a very good one and it went something like this a wonderful movie for people who like to slow down and look at car accidents It s a good snappy line but when you stop and think about it it applies to all horror films and stories The Night of the Living Dead with its gruesome scenes of human cannibalism and matricide was certainly a film for people who like to slow down and look at car accidents and how about that little girl puking pea soup all over the priest in The Exorcist Bram Stoker s Dracula often a basis of comparison for the modern horror story as it should be it is the first with unabashedly psycho-Freudian overtones features a maniac named Renfield who gobbles flies spiders and finally a bird He regurgitates the bird having eaten it feathers and all The novel also features the impalement the ritual penetration one could say of a young and lovely female vampire and the murder of a baby and the baby s mother The great literature of the supernatural often contains the same let s slow down and look at the accident syndrome Beowulf slaughtering Grendel s mother the narrator of The Tell-Tale Heart dismembering his cataract-stricken benefactor and putting the pieces under the floorboards the Hobbit Sam s grim battle with Shelob the spider in the final book of Tolkien s Rings trilogy There will be some who will object strenuously to this line of thought saying that Henry James is not showing us a car accident in The Turn of the Screw they will claim that Nathaniel Hawthorne s stories of the macabre such as Young Goodman Brown and The Minister s Black Veil are also rather more tasteful than Dracula It s a nonsensical idea They are still showing us the car accident the bodies have been removed but we can still see the twisted wreckage and observe the blood on the upholstery In some ways the delicacy the lack of melodrama the low and studied tone of rationality that pervades a story like The Minister s Black Veil is even more terrible than Lovecraft s batrachian monstrosities or the auto-da-fe of Poe s The Pit and the Pendulum The fact is and most of us know this in our hearts that very few of us can forgo an uneasy peek at the wreckage bracketed by police cars and road flares on the turnpike at night Senior citizens pick up the paper in the morning and immediately turn to the obituary column so they can see who they outlived All of us are uneasily transfixed for a moment when we hear that a Dan Blocker has died a Freddie Prinze a Janis Joplin We feel terror mixed with an odd sort of glee when we hear Paul Harvey on the radio telling us that a woman walked into a propeller blade during a rain squall at a small country airport or that a man in a giant industrial blender was vaporized immediately when a co worker stumbled against the controls No need to belabor the obvious life is full of horrors small and large but because the small ones are the ones we can comprehend they are the ones that smack home with all the force of mortality Our interest in these pocket horrors is undeniable but so is our own revulsion The two of them mix uneasily and the by-product of the mix seems to be guilt a guilt which seems not much different from the guilt that used to accompany sexual awakening It is not my business to tell you not to feel guilty any more than it is my business to justify my novels or the short stories which follow But an interesting parallel between sex and fear can be observed As we become capable of having sexual relationships our interest in those relationships awakens the interest unless perverted somehow tends naturally toward copulation and the continuance of the species As we become aware of our own unavoidable termination we become aware of the fear-emotion And I think that as copulation tends toward self-preservation all fear tends toward a comprehension of the final ending There is an old fable about seven blind men who grabbed seven different parts of an elephant One of them thought he had a snake one of them thought he had a giant palm leaf one of them thought he was touching a stone pillar When they got together they decided they had an elephant Fear is the emotion that makes us blind How many things are we afraid of We re afraid to turn off the lights when our hands are wet We re afraid to stick a knife into the toaster to get the stuck English muffin without unplugging it first We re afraid of what the doctor may tell us when the physical exam is over when the airplane suddenly takes a great unearthly lurch in midair We re afraid that the oil may run out that the good air will mn out the good water the good life When the daughter promised to be in by eleven and it s now quarter past twelve and sleet is spatting against the window like dry sand we sit and pretend to watch Johnny Carson and look occasionally at the mute telephone and we feel the emotion that makes us blind the emotion that makes a stealthy ruin of the thinking process The infant is a fearless creature only until the first time the mother isn t there to pop the nipple into his mouth when he cries The toddler quickly discovers the blunt and painful truths of the slamming door the hot burner the fever that goes with the croup or the measles Children learn fear quickly they pick it up off the mother or father s face when the parent comes into the bathroom and sees them with the bottle of pills or the safety razor Fear makes us blind and we touch each fear with all the avid curiosity of self-interest trying to make a whole out of a hundred parts like the blind men with their elephant We sense the shape Children grasp it easily forget it and relearn it as adults The shape is there and most of us come to realize what it is sooner or later it is the shape of a body under a sheet All our fears add up to one great fear all our fears are part of that great fear an arm a leg a finger an ear We re afraid of the body under the sheet It s our body And the great appeal of horror fiction through the ages is that it serves as a rehearsal for our own deaths The field has never been highly regarded for a long time the only friends that Poe and Lovecraft had were the French who have somehow come to an arrangement with both sex and death an arrangement that Poe and Lovecraft s fellow Americans certainly had no patience with The Americans were busy building railroads and Poe and Lovecraft died broke Tolkien s Middle-Earth fantasy went kicking around for twenty years before it became an aboveground success and Kurt Vonnegut whose books so often deal with the death-rehearsal idea has faced a steady wind of criticism much of it mounting to hysterical pitch It may be because the horror writer always brings bad news you re going to die he says he s telling you to never mind Oral Roberts and his something good is going to happen to you because something bad is also going to happen to you and it may be cancer and it may be a stroke and it may be a car accident but it s going to happen And he takes your hand and he enfolds it in his own and he takes you into the room and he puts your hands on the shape under the sheet and tells you to touch it here here and here Of course the subjects of death and fear are not the horror writer s exclusive province Plenty of so-called mainstream writers have dealt with these themes and in a variety of different ways from Fyodor Dostoyevsky s Crime and Punishment to Edward Albee s Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf to Ross Mac-Donald s Lew Archer stories Fear has always been big Death has always been big They are two of the human constants But only the writer of horror and the supernatural gives the reader such an opportunity for total identification and catharsis Those working in the genre with even the faintest understanding of what they are doing know that the entire field of horror and the supernatural is a kind of filter screen between the conscious and the subconscious horror fiction is like a central subway station in the human psyche between the blue line of what we can safely internalize and the red line of what we need to get rid of in some way or another When you read horror you don t really believe what you read You don t believe in vampires werewolves trucks that suddenly start up and drive themselves The horrors that we all do believe in are of the sort that Dostoyevsky and Albee and MacDonald write about hate alienation growing lovelessly old tottering out into a hostile world on the unsteady legs of adolescence We are in our real everyday worlds often like the masks of Comedy and Tragedy grinning on the outside grimacing on the inside There s a central switching point somewhere inside a transformer maybe where the wires leading from those two masks connect And that is the place where the horror story so often hits home The horror-story writer is not so different from the Welsh sin-eater who was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the dear departed by partaking of the dear departed s food The tale of monstrosity and terror is a basket loosely packed with phobias when the writer passes by you take one of his imaginary horrors out of the basket and put one of your real ones in at least for a time Back in the s there was a tremendous surge of giant bug movies Them The Beginning of the End The Deadly Mantis and so on Almost without fail as the movie progressed we found out that these gigantic ugly mutants were the results of A-bomb tests in New Mexico or on deserted Pacific atolls and in the more recent Horror of Party Beach which might have been subtitled Beach Blanket Armageddon the culprit was nuclear-reactor waste Taken together the big-bug movies form an undeniable pattern an uneasy gestalt of a whole country s terror of the new age that the Manhattan Project had mng in Later in the fifties there was a cycle of teen-age horror movies beginning with I Was a Teen-Age Werewolf and culminating with such epics as Teen-Agers from Outer Space and The Blob in which a beardless Steve McQueen battled a sort of Jell- mutant with the help of his teen-aged friends In an age when every weekly magazine contained at least one article on the rising tide of juvenile delinquency the teen-ager fright films expressed a whole country s uneasiness with the youth revolution even then brewing when you saw Michael Landon turn into a werewolf in a high-school letter jacket a connection happened between the fantasy on the screen and your own floating anxieties about the nerd in the hot rod that your daughter was dating To the teen-agers themselves I was one of them and speak from experience the monsters spawned in the leased American-International studios gave them a chance to see someone even uglier than they felt themselves to be what were a few pimples compared to the shambling thing that used to be a high-school kid in I Was a Teen-Age Frankenstein This same cycle also expressed the teen-agers own feeling that they were being unfairly put upon and put down by their elders that their parents just did not understand The movies are formulaic as so much of horror fiction is written or filmed and what the formula expresses most clearly is a whole generation s paranoia a paranoia no doubt caused in part by all the articles their parents were reading In the films some terrible warty horror is menacing Elmville The kids know because the flying saucer landed near lovers lane In the first reel the warty horror kills an old man in a pickup truck the old man was unfailingly played by Elisha Cook Jr In the next three reels the kids try to convince their elders that the warty horror is indeed slinking around Get outta here before I lock you all up for violating the curfew Elmville s police chief growls just before the monster slithers down Main Street laying waste in all directions In the end it is the quick-thinking kids who put an end to the warty horror and then go off to the local hangout to suck up chocolate malteds and jitterbug to some forgettable tune as the end credits run That s three separate opportunities for catharsis in one cycle of movies not bad for a bunch of low-budget epics that were usually done in under ten days It didn t happen because the writers and producers and directors of those films wanted it to happen it happened because the horror tale lives most naturally at that connection point between the conscious and the subconscious the place where both image and allegory occurs most naturally and with the most devastating effect There is a direct line of evolution between I Was a Teen-Age Werewolf and Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange and between Teen- Age Monster and Brian De Palma s film Carrie Great horror fiction is almost always allegorical sometimes the allegory is intended as in Animal Farm and and sometimes it just happens J R R Tolkien swore up and down that the Dark Lord of Mordor was not Hitler in fantasy dress but the theses and term papers to just that effect go on and on maybe because as Bob Dylan says when you got a lot of knives and forks you gotta cut something The works of Edward Albee of Steinbeck Camus Faulkner they deal with fear and death sometimes with horror but usually these mainstream writers deal with it in a more normal real-life way Their work is set in the frame of a rational world they are stories that could happen They are on that subway line that runs through the external world There are other writers James Joyce Faulkner again poets such as T S Eliot and Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton whose work is set in the land of the symbolic unconsciousness They are on the subway line running into the internal landscape But the horror writer is almost always at the terminal joining the two at least if he is on the mark When he is at his best we often have that weird sensation of being not quite asleep or awake when time stretches and skews when we can hear voices but cannot make out the words or the intent when the dream seems real and the reality dreamlike That is a strange and wonderful terminal Hill House is there in that place where the trains run both ways with its doors that swing sensibly shut the woman in the room with the yellow wallpaper is there crawling along the floor with her head pressed against that faint grease mark the barrow-wights that menaced Frodo and Sam are there and Pickman s model the wendigo Norman Bates and his terrible mother No waking or dreaming in this terminal but only the voice of the writer low and rational talking about the way the good fabric of things sometimes has a way of unraveling with shocking suddenness He s telling you that you want to see the car accident and yes he s right you do There s a dead voice on the phone something behind the walls of the old house that sounds bigger than a rat movement at the foot of the cellar stairs He wants you to see all of those things and more he wants you to put your hands on the shape under the sheet And you want to put your hands there Yes These are some of the things I feel that the horror story does but I am firmly convinced that it must do one more thing this above all others It must tell a tale that holds the reader or the listener spellbound for a little while lost in a world that never was never could be It must be like the wedding guest that stoppeth one of three All my life as a writer I have been committed to the idea that in fiction the story value holds dominance over every other facet of the writer s craft characterization theme mood none of those things is anything if the story is dull And if the story does hold you all else can be forgiven My favorite line to that effect came from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs no one s candidate for Great World Writer but a man who understood story values completely On page one of The Land That Time Forgot the narrator finds a manuscript in a bottle the rest of the novel is the presentation of that manuscript The narrator says Read one page and I will be forgotten It s a pledge that Burroughs makes good on many writers with talents greater than his have not In fine gentle reader here is a truth that makes the strongest writer gnash his teeth with the exception of three small groups of people no one reads a writer s preface The exceptions are one the writer s close family usually his wife and his mother two the writer s accredited representative and the editorial people and assorted munchkins whose chief interest is to find out if anyone has been libeled in the course of the writer s wanderings and three those people who have had a hand in helping the writer on his way These are the people who want to know whether or not the writer s head has gotten so big that he has managed to forget that he didn t do it by himself Other readers are apt to feel with perfect justification that the author s preface is a gross imposition a multi-page commercial for himself even more offensive than the cigarette ads that have proliferated in the center section of the paperback books Most readers come to see the show not to watch the stage manager take bows in front of the footlights Again with perfect justification I m leaving now The show is going to start soon We re going to go into that room and touch the shape under the sheet But before I leave I want to take just two or three more minutes of your time to thank some people from each of the three groups above and from a fourth Bear with me as I say a few thank-you s To my wife Tabitha my best and most trenchant critic When she feels the work is good she says so when she feels I ve put my foot in it she sets me on my ass as kindly and lovingly as possible To my kids Naomi Joe and Owen who have been very understanding about their father s peculiar doings in the downstairs room And to my mother who died in and to whom this book is dedicated Her encouragement was steady and unwavering she always seemed able to find forty or fifty cents for the obligatory stamped self-addressed return envelope and no one including myself was more pleased than she when I broke through In that second group particular thanks are due my editor William G Thompson of Doubleday Company who has worked with me patiently who has suffered my daily phone calls with constant good cheer and who showed kindness to a young writer with no credentials some years ago and who has stuck with that writer since then In the third group are the people who first bought my work Mr Robert A W Lowndes who purchased the first two stories I ever sold Mr Douglas Allen and Mr Nye Willden of the Dugent Publishing Corporation who bought so many of the ones that followed for Cavalier and Gent back in the scuffling days when the checks sometimes came just in time to avoid what the power companies euphemistically call an interruption in service to Elaine Geiger and Herbert Schnall and Carolyn Stromberg of the New American Library to Gerard Van der Leun of Penthouse and Harris Deinstfrey of Cosmopolitan Thanks to all of you There s one final group that I d like to thank and that is each and every reader who ever unlimbered his or her wallet to buy something that I wrote In a great many ways this is your book because it sure never would have happened without you So thanks Where I am it s still dark and raining We ve got a fine night for it There s something I want to show you something I want you to touch It s in a room not far from here in fact it s almost as close as the next page Shall we go Bridgton Maine February JERUSALEM S LOT Oct DEAR BONES How good it was to step into the cold draughty hall here at Chapelwaite every bone in an ache from that abominable coach in need of instant relief from my distended bladder and to see a letter addressed in your own inimitable scrawl propped on the obscene little cherry-wood table beside the door Be assured that I set to deciphering it as soon as the needs of the body were attended to in a coldly ornate downstairs bathroom where I could see my breath rising before my eyes I m glad to hear that you are recovered from the miasma that has so long set in your lungs although I assure you that I do sympathize with the moral dilemma the cure has affected you with An ailing abolitionist healed by the sunny climes of slave-struck Florida Still and all Bones I ask you as a friend who has also walked in the valley of the shadow to take all care of yourself and venture not back to Massachusetts until your body gives you leave Your fine mind and incisive pen cannot serve us if you are clay and if the Southern zone is a healing one is there not poetic justice in that Yes the house is quite as fine as I had been led to believe by my cousin s executors but rather more sinister It sits atop a huge and jutting point of land perhaps three miles north of Falmouth and nine miles north of Portland Behind it are some four acres of grounds gone back to the wild in the most formidable manner imaginable junipers scrub vines bushes and various forms of creeper climb wildly over the picturesque stone walls that separate the estate from the town domain Awful imitations of Greek statuary peer blindly through the wrack from atop various hillocks they seem in most cases about to lunge at the passer-by My cousin Stephen s tastes seem to have run the gamut from the unacceptable to the downright horrific There is an odd little summer house which has been nearly buried in scarlet sumac and a grotesque sundial in the midst of what must once have been a garden It adds the final lunatic touch But the view from the parlour more than excuses this I command a dizzying view of the rocks at the foot of Chapelwaite Head and the Atlantic itself A huge bellied bay window looks out on this and a huge toadlike secretary stands beside it It will do nicely for the start of that novel which I have talked of so long and no doubt tiresomely To-day has been gray with occasional splatters of rain As I look out all seems to be a study in slate the rocks old and worn as Time itself the sky and of course the sea which crashes against the granite fangs below with a sound which is not precisely sound but vibration I can feel the waves with my feet even as I write The sensation is not a wholly unpleasant one I know you disapprove my solitary habits dear Bones but I assure you that I am fine and happy Calvin is with me as practical silent and as dependable as ever and by midweek I am sure that between the two of us we shall have straightened our affairs and made arrangement for necessary deliveries from town and a company of cleaning women to begin blowing the dust from this place I will close there are so many things as yet to be seen rooms to explore and doubtless a thousand pieces of execrable furniture to be viewed by these tender eyes Once again my thanks for the touch of familiar brought by your letter and for your continuing regard Give my love to your wife as you both have mine CHARLES Oct DEAR BONES Such a place this is It continues to amaze me as do the reactions of the townfolk in the closest village to my occupancy That is a queer little place with the picturesque name of Preacher s Corners It was there that Calvin contracted for the weekly provisions The other errand that of securing a sufficient supply of cordwood for the winter was likewise taken care of But Cal returned with gloomy countenance and when I asked him what the trouble was he replied grimly enough They think you mad Mr Boone I laughed and said that perhaps they had heard of the brain fever I suffered after my Sarah died certainly I spoke madly enough at that time as you could attest But Cal protested that no-one knew anything of me except through my cousin Stephen who contracted for the same services as I have now made provision for What was said sir was that anyone who would live in Chapelwaite must be either a lunatic or run the risk of becoming one This left me utterly perplexed as you may imagine and I asked who had given him this amazing communication He told me that he had been referred to a sullen and rather besotted pulp-logger named Thompson who owns four hundred acres of pine birch and spruce and who logs it with the help of his five sons for sale to the mills in Portland and to householders in the immediate area When Cal all unknowing of his queer prejudice gave him the location to which the wood was to be brought this Thompson stared at him with his mouth ajaw and said that he would send his sons with the wood in the good light of the day and by the sea road Calvin apparently misreading my bemusement for distress hastened to say that the man reeked of cheap whiskey and that he had then lapsed into some kind of nonsense about a deserted village and cousin Stephen s relations and worms Calvin finished his business with one of Thompson s boys who I take it was rather surly and none too sober or freshly-scented himself I take it there has been some of this reaction in Preacher s Corners itself at the general store where Cal spoke with the shop-keeper although this was more of the gossipy behind-the-hand type None of this has bothered me much we know how rustics dearly love to enrich their lives with the smell of scandal and myth and I suppose poor Stephen and his side of the family are fair game As I told Cal a man who has fallen to his death almost from his own front porch is more than likely to stir talk The house itself is a constant amazement Twenty-three rooms Bones The wainscotting which panels the upper floors and the portrait gallery is mildewed but still stout While I stood in my late cousin s upstairs bedroom I could hear the rats scuttering behind it and big ones they must be from the sound they make almost like people walking there I should hate to encounter one in the dark or even in the light for that matter Still I have noted neither holes nor droppings Odd The upper gallery is lined with bad portraits in frames which must be worth a fortune Some bear a resemblance to Stephen as I remember him I believe I have correctly identified my Uncle Henry Boone and his wife Judith the others are unfamiliar I suppose one of them may be my own notorious grandfather Robert But Stephen s side of the family is all but unknown to me for which I am heartily sorry The same good humour that shone in Stephen s letters to Sarah and me the same light of high intellect shines in these portraits bad as they are For what foolish reasons families fall out A rifled escritoire hard words between brothers now dead three generations and blameless descendants are needlessly estranged I cannot help reflecting upon how fortunate it was that you and John Petty succeeded in contacting Stephen when it seemed I might follow my Sarah through the Gates and upon how unfortunate it was that chance should have robbed us of a face-to-face meeting How I would have loved to hear him defend the ancestral statuary and furnishings But do not let me denigrate the place to an extreme Stephen s taste was not my own true but beneath the veneer of his additions there are pieces a number of them shrouded by dust-covers in the upper chambers which are true master-works There are beds tables and heavy dark scrollings done in teak and mahogany and many of the bedrooms and receiving chambers the upper study and small parlour hold a somber charm The floors are rich pine that glow with an inner and secret light There is dignity here dignity and the weight of years I cannot yet say I like it but I do respect it I am eager to watch it change as we revolve through the changes of this northern clime Lord I run on Write soon Bones Tell me what progress you make and what news you hear from Petty and the rest And please do not make the mistake of trying to persuade any new Southern acquaintances as to your views too forcibly I understand that not all are content to answer merely with their mouths as is our long-winded friend Mr Calhoun Yr affectionate friend CHARLES Oct DEAR RICHARD Hello and how are you I have thought about you often since I have taken up residence here at Chapelwaite and had half-expected to hear from you and now I receive a letter from Bones telling me that I d forgotten to leave my address at the club Rest assured that I would have written eventually anyway as it sometimes seems that my true and loyal friends are all I have left in the world that is sure and completely normal And Lord how spread we ve become You in Boston writing faithfully for The Liberator to which I have also sent my address incidentally Hanson in England on another of his confounded jaunts and poor old Bones in the very lions lair recovering his lungs It goes as well as can be expected here Dick and be assured I will render you a full account when I am not quite as pressed by certain events which are extant here I think your legal mind may be quite intrigued by certain happenings at Chapelwaite and in the area about it But in the meantime I have a favour to ask if you will entertain it Do you remember the historian you introduced me to at Mr Clary s fund-raising dinner for the cause I believe his name was Bigelow At any rate he mentioned that he made a hobby of collecting odd bits of historical lore which pertained to the very area in which I am now living My favour then is this Would you contact him and ask him what facts bits of folklore or general rumour if any he may be conversant with about a small deserted village called JERUSALEM S LOT near a town-ship called Preacher s Corners on the Royal River The stream itself is a tributary of the Androscoggin and flows into that river approximately eleven miles above that river s emptying place near Chapelwaite It would gratify me intensely and more important may be a matter of some moment In looking over this letter I feel I have been a bit short with you Dick for which I am heartily sorry But be assured I will explain myself shortly and until that time I send my warmest regards to your wife two fine sons and of course to yourself Yr affectionate friend CHARLES Oct DEAR BONES I have a tale to tell you which seems a little strange and even disquieting to both Cal and me see what you think If nothing else it may serve to amuse you while you battle the mosquitoes Two days after I mailed my last to you a group of four young ladies arrived from the Corners under the supervision of an elderly lady of intimidatingly-competent visage named Mrs Cloris to set the place in order and to remove some of the dust that had been causing me to sneeze seemingly at every other step They all seemed a little nervous as they went about their chores indeed one flighty miss uttered a small screech when I entered the upstairs parlour as she dusted I asked Mrs Cloris about this she was dusting the downstairs hall with grim determination that would have quite amazed you her hair done up in an old faded bandanna and she turned to me and said with an air of determination They don t like the house and I don t like the house sir because it has always been a bad house My jaw dropped at this unexpected bit and she went on in a kindlier tone I do not mean to say that Stephen Boone was not a fine man for he was I cleaned for him every second Thursday all the time he was here as I cleaned for his father Mr Randolph Boone until he and his wife disappeared in eighteen and sixteen Mr Stephen was a good and kindly man and so you seem sir if you will pardon my bluntness I know no other way to speak but the house is bad and it always has been and no Boone has ever been happy here since your grandfather Robert and his brother Philip fell out over stolen and here she paused almost guiltily items in seventeen and eighty-nine Such memories these folks have Bones Mrs Cloris continued The house was built in unhappiness has been lived in with unhappiness there has been blood spilt on its floors as you may or may not know Bones my Uncle Randolph was involved in an accident on the cellar stairs which took the life of his daughter Marcella he then took his own life in a fit of remorse The incident is related in one of Stephen s letters to me on the sad occasion of his dead sister s birthday there has been disappearance and accident I have worked here Mr Boone and I am neither blind nor deaf I ve heard awful sounds in the walls sir awful sounds thumpings and crashings and once a strange wailing that was half-laughter It fair made my blood curdle It s a dark place sir And there she halted perhaps afraid she had spoken too much As for myself I hardly knew whether to be offended or amused curious or merely matter-of-fact I m afraid that amusement won the day And what do you suspect Mrs Cloris Ghosts rattling chains But she only looked at me oddly Ghosts there may be But it s not ghosts in the walls It s not ghosts that wail and blubber like the damned and crash and blunder away in the darkness It s Come Mrs Cloris I prompted her You ve come this far Now can you finish what you ve begun The strangest expression of terror pique and I would swear to it religious awe passed over her face Some die not she whispered Some live in the twilight shadows Between to serve Him And that was the end For some minutes I continued to tax her but she grew only more obstinate and would say no more At last I desisted fearing she might gather herself up and quit the premises This is the end of one episode but a second occurred the following evening Calvin had laid a fire downstairs and I was sitting in the living-room drowsing over a copy of The Intelligencer and listening to the sound of wind-driven rain on the large bay window I felt comfortable as only one can on such a night when all is miserable outside and all is warmth and comfort inside but a moment later Cal appeared at the door looking excited and a bit nervous Are you awake sir he asked Barely I said What is it I ve found something upstairs I think you should see he responded with the same air of suppressed excitement I got up and followed him As we climbed the wide stairs Calvin said I was reading a book in the upstairs study a rather strange one when I heard a noise in the wall Rats I said Is that all He paused on the landing looking at me solemnly The lamp he held cast weird lurking shadows on the dark draperies and on the half-seen portraits that seemed now to leer rather than smile Outside the wind rose to a brief scream and then subsided grudgingly Not rats Cal said There was a kind of blundering thudding sound from behind the book-cases and then a horrible gurgling horrible sir And scratching as if something were struggling to get out to get at me You can imagine my amazement Bones Calvin is not the type to give way to hysterical flights of imagination It began to seem that there was a mystery here after all and perhaps an ugly one indeed What then I asked him We had resumed down the hall and I could see the light from the study spilling forth onto the floor of the gallery I viewed it with some trepidation the night seemed no longer comfortable The scratching noise stopped After a moment the thudding shuffling sounds began again this time moving away from me It paused once and I swear I heard a strange almost inaudible laugh I went to the book-case and began to push and pull thinking there might be a partition or a secret door You found one Cal paused at the door to the study No but I found this We stepped in and I saw a square black hole in the left case The books at that point were nothing but dummies and what Cal had found was a small hiding place I flashed my lamp within it and saw nothing but a thick fall of dust dust which must have been decades old There was only this Cal said quietly and handed me a yellowed foolscap The thing was a map drawn in spider-thin strokes of black ink the map of a town or village There were perhaps seven buildings and one clearly marked with a steeple bore this legend beneath it The Worm That Doth Corrupt In the upper left corner to what would have been the northwest of this little village an arrow pointed Inscribed beneath it Chapelwaite Calvin said In town sir someone rather superstitiously mentioned a deserted village called Jerusalem s Lot It s a place they steer clear of But this I asked fingering the odd legend below the steeple I don t know A memory of Mrs Cloris adamant yet fearful passed through my mind The Worm I muttered Do you know something Mr Boone Perhaps it might be amusing to have a look for this town tomorrow do you think Cal He nodded eyes lighting We spent almost an hour after this looking for some breach in the wall behind the cubby-hole Cal had found but with no success Nor was there a recurrence of the noises Cal had described We retired with no further adventure that night On the following morning Calvin and I set out on our ramble through the woods The rain of the night before had ceased but the sky was somber and lowering I could see Cal looking at me with some doubtfulness and I hastened to reassure him that should I tire or the journey prove too far I would not hesitate to call a halt to the affair We had equipped ourselves with a picnic lunch a fine Buckwhite compass and of course the odd and ancient map of Jerusalem s Lot It was a strange and brooding day not a bird seemed to sing nor an animal to move as we made our way through the great and gloomy stands of pine to the south and east The only sounds were those of our own feet and the steady pound of the Atlantic against the headlands The smell of the sea almost preternaturally heavy was our constant companion We had gone no more than two miles when we struck an overgrown road of what I believe were once called the corduroy variety this tended in our general direction and we struck off along it making brisk time We spoke little The day with its still and ominous quality weighed heavily on our spirits At about eleven o clock we heard the sound of rushing water The remnant of road took a hard turn to the left and on the other side of a boiling slaty little stream like an apparition was Jerusalem s Lot The stream was perhaps eight feet across spanned by a moss-grown footbridge On the far side Bones stood the most perfect little village you might imagine understandably weathered but amazingly preserved Several houses done in that austere yet commanding form for which the Puritans were justly famous stood clustered near the steeply-sheared bank Further beyond along a weed-grown thoroughfare stood three or four of what might have been primitive business establishments and beyond that the spire of the church marked on the map rising up to the gray sky and looking grim beyond description with its peeled paint and tarnished leaning cross The town is well named Cal said softly beside me We crossed to the town and began to poke through it and this is where my story grows slightly amazing Bones so prepare yourself The air seemed leaden as we walked among the buildings weighted if you will The edifices were in a state of decay shutters torn off roofs crumbled under the weight of heavy snows gone by windows dusty and leering Shadows from odd corners and warped angles seemed to sit in sinister pools We entered an old and rotting tavern first somehow it did not seem right that we should invade any of those houses to which people had retired when they wished privacy An old and weather-scrubbed sign above the splintered door announced that this had been the boar s head inn and tavern The door creaked hellishly on its one remaining hinge and we stepped into the shadowed interior The smell of rot and mould was vaporous and nearly overpowering And beneath it seemed to lie an even deeper smell a slimy and pestiferous smell a smell of ages and the decay of ages Such a stench as might issue from corrupt coffins or violated tombs I held my handkerchief to my nose and Cal did likewise We surveyed the place My God sir Cal said faintly It s never been touched I finished for him As indeed it had not Tables and chairs stood about like ghostly guardians of the watch dusty warped by the extreme changes in temperature which the New England climate is known for but otherwise perfect as if they had waited through the silent echoing decades for those long gone to enter once more to call for a pint or a dram to deal cards and light clay pipes A small square mirror hung beside the rules of the tavern unbroken Do you see the significance Bones Small boys are noted for exploration and vandalism there is not a haunted house which stands with windows intact no matter how fearsome the eldritch inhabitants are rumoured to be not a shadowy graveyard without at least one tombstone upended by young pranksters Certainly there must be a score of young pranksters in Preacher s Corners not two miles from Jerusalem s Lot Yet the inn-keeper s glass which must have cost him a nice sum was intact as were the other fragile items we found in our pokings The only damage in Jerusalem s Lot has been done by impersonal Nature The implication is obvious Jerusalem s Lot is a shunned town But why I have a notion but before I even dare hint at it I must proceed to the unsettling conclusion of our visit We went up to the sleeping quarters and found beds made up pewter water-pitchers neatly placed beside them The kitchen was likewise untouched by anything save the dust of the years and that horrible sunken stench of decay The tavern alone would be an antiquarian s paradise the wondrously queer kitchen stove alone would fetch a pretty price at Boston auction What do you think Cal I asked when we had emerged again into the uncertain daylight I think it s bad business Mr Boone he replied in his doleful way and that we must see more to know more We gave the other shops scant notice there was a hostelry with mouldering leather goods still hung on rusted flatnails a chandler s a warehouse with oak and pine still stacked within a smithy We entered two houses as we made our way toward the church at the center of the village Both were perfectly in the Puritan mode full of items a collector would give his arm for both deserted and full of the same rotten scent Nothing seemed to live or move in all of this but ourselves We saw no insects no birds not even a cobweb fashioned in a window corner Only dust At last we reached the church It reared above us grim uninviting cold Its windows were black with the shadows inside and any Godliness or sanctity had departed from it long ago Of that I am certain We mounted the steps and I placed my hand on the large iron door-pull A set dark look passed from myself to Calvin and back again I opened the portal How long since that door had been touched I would say with confidence that mine was the first in fifty years perhaps longer Rust-clogged hinges screamed as I opened it The smell of rot and decay which smote us was nearly palpable Cal made a gagging sound in his throat and twisted his head involuntarily for clearer air Sir he asked are you sure that you are I m fine I said calmly But I did not feel calm Bones no more than I do now I believe with Moses with Jereboam with Increase Mather and with our own Hanson when he is in a philosophical temperament that there are spiritually noxious places buildings where the milk of the cosmos has become sour and rancid This church is such a place I would swear to it We stepped into a long vestibule equipped with a dusty coat rack and shelved hymnals It was windowless Oil-lamps stood in niches here and there An unremarkable room I thought until I heard Calvin s sharp gasp and saw what he had already noticed It was an obscenity I daren t describe that elaborately-framed picture further than this that it was done after the fleshy style of Rubens that it contained a grotesque travesty of a madonna and child that strange half-shadowed creatures sported and crawled in the background Lord I whispered There s no Lord here Calvin said and his words seemed to hang in the air I opened the door leading into the church itself and the odor became a miasma nearly overpowering In the glimmering half-light of afternoon the pews stretched ghostlike to the altar Above them was a high oaken pulpit and a shadow-struck narthex from which gold glimmered With a half-sob Calvin that devout Protestant made the Holy Sign and I followed suit For the gold was a large beautifully-wrought cross but it was hung upside-down symbol of Satan s Mass We must be calm I heard myself saying We must be calm Calvin We must be calm But a shadow had touched my heart and I was afraid as I had never been I have walked beneath death s umbrella and thought there was none darker But there is There is We walked down the aisle our footfalls echoing above and around us We left tracks in the dust And at the altar there were other tenebrous objets d art I will not cannot let my mind dwell upon them I began to mount to the pulpit itself Don t Mr Boone Cal cried suddenly I m afraid But I had gained it A huge book lay open upon the stand writ both in Latin and crabbed runes which looked to my unpractised eye either Druidic or pre-Celtic I enclose a card with several of the symbols redrawn from memory I closed the book and looked at the words stamped into the leather De Vermis Mysteriis My Latin is rusty but serviceable enough to translate The Mysteries of the Worm As I touched it that accursed church and Calvin s white upturned face seemed to swim before me It seemed that I heard low chanting voices full of hideous yet eager fear and below that sound another filling the bowels of the earth An hallucination I doubt it not but at the same moment the church was filled with a very real sound which I can only describe as a huge and macabre turning beneath my feet The pulpit trembled beneath my fingers the desecrated cross trembled on the wall We exited together Cal and I leaving the place to its own darkness and neither of us dared look back until we had crossed the rude planks spanning the stream I will not say we defiled the nineteen hundred years man has spent climbing upward from a hunkering and superstitious savage by actually running but I would be a liar to say that we strolled That is my tale You mustn t shadow your recovery by fearing that the fever has touched me again Cal can attest to all in these pages up to and including the hideous noise So I close saying only that I wish I might see you knowing that much of my bewilderment would drop away immediately and that I remain your friend and admirer CHARLES Oct DEAR GENTLEMEN In the most recent edition of your catalogue of household items i e Summer I noticed a preparation which is titled Rat s Bane I should like to purchase one pound tin of this preparation at your stated price of thirty cents I enclose return postage Please mail to Calvin McCann Chapelwaite Preacher s Corners Cumberland County Maine Thank you for your attention in this matter I remain dear Gentlemen CALVIN McCANN Oct DEAR BONES Developments of a disquieting nature The noises in the house have intensified and I am growing more to the conclusion that rats are not all that move within our walls Calvin and I went on another fruitless search for hidden crannies or passages but found nothing How poorly we would fit into one of Mrs Radcliffe s romances Cal claims however that much of the sound emanates from the cellar and it is there we intend to explore tomorrow It makes me no easier to know that Cousin Stephen s sister met her unfortunate end there Her portrait by the by hangs in the upstairs gallery Marcella Boone was a sadly pretty thing if the artist got her right and I do know she never married At times I think that Mrs Cloris was right that it is a bad house It has certainly held nothing but gloom for its past inhabitants But I have more to say of the redoubtable Mrs Cloris for I have had this day a second interview with her As the most level-headed person from the Corners that I have met thus far I sought her out this afternoon after an unpleasant interview which I will relate The wood was to have been delivered this morning and when noon came and passed and no wood with it I decided to take my daily walk into the town itself My object was to visit Thompson the man with whom Cal did business It has been a lovely day full of the crisp snap of bright autumn and by the time I reached the Thompsons homestead Cal who remained home to poke further through Uncle Stephen s library gave me adequate directions I felt in the best mood that these last few days have seen and quite prepared to forgive Thompson s tardiness with the wood The place was a massive tangle of weeds and fallen-down buildings in need of paint to the left of the barn a huge sow ready for November butchering grunted and wallowed in a muddy sty and in the littered yard between house and outbuildings a woman in a tattered gingham dress was feeding chickens from her apron When I hailed her she turned a pale and vapid face toward me The sudden change in expression from utter doltish emptiness to one of frenzied terror was quite wonderful to behold I can only think she took me for Stephen himself for she raised her hand in the prong-fingered sign of the evil eye and screamed The chicken-feed scattered on the ground and the fowls fluttered away squawking Before I could utter a sound a huge hulking figure of a man clad only in long-handled underwear lumbered out of the house with a squirrel-rifle in one hand and a jug in the other From the red light in his eye and unsteady manner of walking I judged that this was Thompson the Woodcutter himself A Boone he roared G d n your eyes He dropped the jug a-rolling and also made the Sign I ve come I said with as much equanimity as I could muster under the circumstances because the wood has not According to the agreement you struck with my man G d n your man too say I And for the first time I noticed that beneath his bluff and bluster he was deadly afraid I began seriously to wonder if he mightn t actually use his rifle against me in his excitement I began carefully As a gesture of courtesy you might G d n your courtesy Very well then I said with as much dignity as I could muster I bid you good day until you are more in control of yourself And with this I turned away and began down the road to the village Don tchee come back he screamed after me Stick wi your evil up there Cursed Cursed Cursed He pelted a stone at me which struck my shoulder I would not give him the satisfaction of dodging So I sought out Mrs Cloris determined to solve the mystery of Thompson s enmity at least She is a widow and none of your confounded matchmaking Bones she is easily fifteen years my senior and I ll not see forty again and lives by herself in a charming little cottage at the ocean s very doorstep I found the lady hanging out her wash and she seemed genuinely pleased to see me I found this a great relief it is vexing almost beyond words to be branded pariah for no understandable reason Mr Boone said she offering a half-curtsey If you ve come about washing I take none in past September My rheumatiz pains me so that it s trouble enough to do my own I wish laundry was the subject of my visit I ve come for help Mrs Cloris I must know all you can tell me about Chapelwaite and Jerusalem s Lot and why the townfolk regard me with such fear and suspicion Jerusalem s Lot You know about that then Yes I replied and visited it with my companion a week ago God She went pale as milk and tottered I put out a hand to steady her Her eyes rolled horribly and for a moment I was sure she would swoon Mrs Cloris I am sorry if I have said anything to Come inside she said You must know Sweet Jesu the evil days have come again She would not speak more until she had brewed strong tea in her sunshiny kitchen When it was before us she looked pensively out at the ocean for a time Inevitably her eyes and mine were drawn to the jutting brow of Chapelwaite Head where the house looked out over the water The large bay window glittered in the rays of the westering sun like a diamond The view was beautiful but strangely disturbing She suddenly turned to me and declared vehemently Mr Boone you must leave Chapelwaite immediately I was flabbergasted There has been an evil breath in the air since you took up residence In the last week since you set foot in the accursed place there have been omens and portents A caul over the face of the moon flocks of whippoorwills which roost in the cemeteries an unnatural birth You must leave When I found my tongue I spoke as gently as I could Mrs Cloris these things are dreams You must know that Is it a dream that Barbara Brown gave birth to a child with no eyes Or that Clifton Brockett found a flat pressed trail five feet wide in the woods beyond Chapelwaite where all had withered and gone white And can you who have visited Jerusalem s Lot say with truth that nothing still lives there I could not answer the scene in that hideous church sprang before my eyes She clamped her gnarled hands together in an effort to calm herself I know of these things only from my mother and her mother before her Do you know the history of your family as it applies to Chapelwaite Vaguely I said The house has been the home of Philip Boone s line since the s his brother Robert my grandfather located in Massachusetts after an argument over stolen papers Of Philip s side I know little except that an unhappy shadow fell over it extending from father to son to grand-children Marcella died in a tragic accident and Stephen fell to his death It was his wish that Chapelwaite become the home of me and mine and that the family rift thus be mended Never to be mended she whispered You know nothing of the original quarrel Robert Boone was discovered rifling his brother s desk Philip Boone was mad she said A man who trafficked with the unholy The thing which Robert Boone attempted to remove was a profane Bible writ in the old tongues Latin Druidic others A hell-book De Vermis Mysteriis She recoiled as if struck You know of it I have seen it touched it It seemed again she might swoon A hand went to her mouth as if to stifle an outcry Yes in Jerusalem s Lot On the pulpit of a corrupt and desecrated church Still there still there then She rocked in her chair I had hoped God in His wisdom had cast it into the pit of hell What relation had Philip Boone to Jerusalem s Lot Blood relation she said darkly The Mark of the Beast was on him although he walked in the clothes of the Lamb And on the night of October Philip Boone disappeared and the entire populace of that damned village with him She would say little more in fact seemed to know little more She would only reiterate her pleas that I leave giving as reason something about blood calling to blood and muttering about those who watch and those who guard As twilight drew on she seemed to grow more agitated rather than less and to placate her I promised that her wishes would be taken under strong consideration I walked home through lengthening gloomy shadows my good mood quite dissipated and my head spinning with questions which still plague me Cal greeted me with the news that our noises in the walls have grown worse still as I can attest at this moment I try to tell myself that I hear only rats but then I see the terrified earnest face of Mrs Cloris The moon has risen over the sea bloated full the colour of blood staining the ocean with a noxious shade My mind turns to that church again and here a line is struck out But you shall not see that Bones It is too mad It is time I slept I think My thoughts go out to you Regards CHARLES The following is from the pocket journal of Calvin McCann Oct Took the liberty this morning of forcing the lock which binds the book closed did it before Mr Boone arose No help it is all in cypher A simple one I believe Perhaps I may break it as easily as the lock A diary I am certain the hand oddly like Mr Boone s own Whose book shelved in the most obscure corner of this library and locked across the pages It seems old but how to tell The corrupting air has largely been kept from its pages More later if time Mr Boone set upon looking about the cellar Am afraid these dreadful goings-on will be too much for his chancy health yet I must try to persuade him But he comes Oct BONES I can t write I cant sic write of this yet From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann Oct As I had feared his health has broken Dear God our Father Who art in Heaven Cannot bear to think of it yet it is planted burned on my brain like a tin-type that horror in the cellar Alone now half-past eight o clock house silent but Found him swooned over his writing table he still sleeps yet for those few moments how nobly he acquitted himself while I stood paralyzed and shattered His skin is waxy cool Not the fever again God be thanked I daren t move him or leave him to go to the village And if I did go who would return with me to aid him Who would come to this cursed house O the cellar The things in the cellar that have haunted our walls Oct DEAR BONES I am myself again although weak after thirty-six hours of unconsciousness Myself again what a grim and bitter joke I shall never be myself again never I have come face to face with an insanity and a horror beyond the limits of human expression And the end is not yet If it were not for Cal I believe I should end my life this minute He is one island of sanity in all this madness You shall know it all We had equipped ourselves with candles for our cellar exploration and they threw a strong glow that was quite adequate hellishly adequate Calvin tried to dissuade me citing my recent illness saying that the most we should probably find would be some healthy rats to mark for poisoning I remained determined however Calvin fetched a sigh and answered Have it as you must then Mr Boone The entrance to the cellar is by means of a trap in the kitchen floor which Cal assures me he has since stoutly boarded over and we raised it only with a great deal of straining and lifting A foetid overpowering smell came up out of the darkness not unlike that which pervaded the deserted town across the Royal River The candle I held shed its glow on a steeply-slanting flight of stairs leading down into darkness They were in a terrible state of repair in one place an entire riser missing leaving only a black hole and it was easy enough to see how the unfortunate Marcella might have come to her end there Be careful Mr Boone Cal said I told him I had no intention of being anything but and we made the descent The floor was earthen the walls of stout granite and hardly wet The place did not look like a rat haven at all for there were none of the things rats like to make their nests in such as old boxes discarded furniture piles of paper and the like We lifted our candles gaining a small circle of light but still able to see little The floor had a gradual slope which seemed to run beneath the main living-room and the dining-room i e to the west It was in this direction we walked All was in utter silence The stench in the air grew steadily stronger and the dark about us seemed to press like wool as if jealous of the light which had temporarily deposed it after so many years of undisputed dominion At the far end the granite walls gave way to a polished wood which seemed totally black and without reflective properties Here the cellar ended leaving what seemed to be an alcove off the main chamber It was positioned at an angle which made inspection impossible without stepping around the corner Calvin and I did so It was as if a rotten spectre of this dwelling s sinister past had risen before us A single chair stood in this alcove and above it fastened from a hook in one of the stout overhead beams was a decayed noose of hemp Then it was here that he hung himself Cal muttered God Yes with the corpse of his daughter lying at the foot of the stairs behind him Cal began to speak then I saw his eyes jerked to a spot behind me then his words became a scream How Bones can I describe the sight which fell upon our eyes How can I tell you of the hideous tenants within our walls The far wall swung back and from that darkness a face leered a face with eyes as ebon as the Styx itself Its mouth yawned in a toothless agonized grin one yellow rotted hand stretched itself out to us It made a hideous mewling sound and took a shambling step forward The light from my candle fell upon it And I saw the livid rope-burn about its neck From beyond it something else moved something I shall dream of until the day when all dreams cease a girl with a pallid mouldering face and a corpse-grin a girl whose head lolled at a lunatic angle They wanted us I know it And I know they would have drawn us into that darkness and made us their own had I not thrown my candle directly at the thing in the partition and followed it with the chair beneath that noose After that all is confused darkness My mind has drawn the curtain I awoke as I have said in my room with Cal at my side If I could leave I should fly from this house of horror with my nightdress flapping at my heels But I cannot I have become a pawn in a deeper darker drama Do not ask how I know I only do Mrs Cloris was right when she spoke of blood calling to blood and how horribly right when she spoke of those who watch and those who guard I fear that I have wakened a Force which has slept in the tenebrous village of Salem s Lot for half a century a Force which has slain my ancestors and taken them in unholy bondage as nosferatu the Undead And I have greater fears than these Bones but I still see only in part If I knew if I only knew all CHARLES Postscriptum And of course I write this only for myself we are isolated from Preacher s Corners I daren t carry my taint there to post this and Calvin will not leave me Perhaps if God is good this will reach you in some manner C From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann Oct He is stronger to-day we talked briefly of the apparitions in the cellar agreed they were neither hallucinations or of an ectoplasmic origin but real Does Mr Boone suspect as I do that they have gone Perhaps the noises are still yet all is ominous yet o ercast with a dark pall It seems we wait in the deceptive Eye of the Storm Have found a packet of papers in an upstairs bedroom lying in the bottom drawer of an old roll-top desk Some correspondence receipted bills lead me to believe the room was Robert Boone s Yet the most interesting document is a few jottings on the back of an advertisement for gentlemen s beaver hats At the top is writ Blessed are the meek Below the following apparent nonsense is writ bke dshdermthes eak elmsoerare shamded I believe tis the key of the locked and coded book in the

besdrteek lseaehme Read up and down rather than across the result is the original quotation from the Beatitudes Before I dare show this to Mr Boone I must be sure of the book s contents Oct DEAR BONES An amazing occurrence Cal always close-mouthed until absolutely sure of himself a rare and admirable human trait has found the diary of my grandfather Robert The document was in a code which Cal himself has broken He modestly declares that the discovery was an accident but I suspect that perseverance and hard work had rather more to do with it At any rate what a somber light it sheds on our mysteries here The first entry is dated June the last October four days before the cataclysmic disappearance of which Mrs Cloris spoke It tells a tale of deepening obsession nay of madness and makes hideously clear the relationship between Great- uncle Philip the town of Jerusalem s Lot and the book which rests in that desecrated church The town itself according to Robert Boone pre-dates Chapelwaite built in and Preacher s Corners known in those days as Preacher s Rest and founded in it was founded by a splinter group of the Puritan faith in a sect headed by a dour religious fanatic named James Boon What a start that name gave me That this Boon bore relation to my family can hardly be doubted I believe Mrs Cloris could not have been more right in her superstitious belief that familial bloodline is of crucial importance in this matter and I recall with terror her answer to my question about Philip and his relationship to Salem s Lot Blood relation said she and I fear that it is so The town became a settled community built around the church where Boon preached or held court My grandfather intimates that he also held commerce with any number of ladies from the town assuring them that this was God s way and will As a result the town became an anomaly which could only have existed in those isolated and queer days when belief in witches and the Virgin Birth existed hand in hand an interbred rather degenerate religious village controlled by a half-mad preacher whose twin gospels were the Bible and de Goudge s sinister Demon Dwellings a community in which rites of exorcism were held regularly a community of incest and the insanity and physical defects which so often accompany that sin I suspect and believe Robert Boone must have also that one of Boon s bastard offspring must have left or have been spirited away from Jerusalem s Lot to seek his fortune to the south and thus founded our present lineage I do know by my own family reckoning that our clan supposedly originated in that part of Massachusetts which has so lately become this Sovereign State of Maine My great grandfather Kenneth Boone became a rich man as a result of the then-flourishing fur trade It was his money increased by time and wise investment which built this ancestral home long after his death in His sons Philip and Robert built Chapelwaite Blood calls to blood Mrs Cloris said Could it be that Kenneth was born of James Boon fled the madness of his father and his father s town only to have his sons all-unknowing build the Boone home not two miles from the Boon beginnings If tis true does it not seem that some huge and invisible Hand has guided us According to Robert s diary James Boon was ancient in and he must have been Granting him an age of twenty-five in the year of the town s founding he would have been one hundred and four a prodigious age The following is quoted direct from Robert Boone s diary August To-day for the first time I met this Man with whom my Brother has been so unhealthily taken I must admit this Boon controls a strange Magnetism which upset me Greatly He is a veritable Ancient white-bearded and dresses in a black Cassock which struck me as somehow obscene More disturbing yet was the Fact that he was surrounded by Women as a Sultan would be surrounded by his Harem and P assures me he is active yet although at least an Octogenarian The Village itself I had visited only once before and will not visit again its Streets are silent and filled with the Fear the old Man inspires from his Pulpit I fear also that Like has mated with Like as so many of the Faces are similar It seemed that each way I turned I beheld the old Man s Visage all are so wan they seem Lack-Luster as if sucked dry of all Vitality I beheld Eyeless and Noseless Children Women who wept and gibbered and pointed at the Sky for no Reason and garbled talk from the Scriptures with talk of Demons P wished me to stay for Services but the thought of that sinister Ancient in the Pulpit before an Audience of this Town s interbred Populace repulsed me and I made an Excuse The entries preceding and following this tell of Philip s growing fascination with James Boon On September Philip was baptized into Boon s church His brother says I am aghast with Amaze and Horror my Brother has changed before my very Eyes he even seems to grow to resemble the wretched Man First mention of the book occurs on July Robert s diary records it only briefly P returned from the smaller Village to-night with I thought a rather wild Visage Would not speak until Bedtime when he said that Boon had enquired after a Book titled Mysteries of the Worm To please P I promised to write Johns Goodfellow a letter of enquiry P almost fawningly Grateful On August this notation Rec d two Letters in the Post to-day one from Johns Goodfellow in Boston They have Note of the Tome in which P has expressed an Interest Only five Copies extant in this Country The Letter is rather cool odd indeed Have known Henry Goodfellow for Years August P insanely excited by Goodfellow s letter refuses to say why He would only say that Boon is exceedingly anxious to obtain a Copy Cannot think why since by the Title it seems only a harmless gardening Treatise Am worried for Philip he grows stranger to me Daily I wish now we had not returned to Chapelwaite The Summer is hot oppressive and filled with Omens There are only two further mentions of the infamous book in Robert s diary he seems not to have realized the true importance of it even at the end From the entry of September I have petitioned Goodfellow to act as P s Agent in the matter of the Purchase although my better Judgement cries against It What use to demur Has he not his own Money should I refuse And in return I have extracted a Promise from Philip to recant this noisome Baptism yet he is so Hectic nearly Feverish I do not trust him I am hopelessly at Sea in this Matter Finally September The Book arrived to-day with a note from Goodfellow saying he wishes no more of my Trade P was excited to an unnatural Degree all but snatched the Book from my Hands It is writ in bastard Latin and a Runic Script of which I can read Nothing The Thing seemed almost warm to the Touch and to vibrate in my Hands as if it contained a huge Power I reminded P of his Promise to Recant and he only laughed in an ugly crazed Fashion and waved that Book in my Face crying over and over again We have it We have it The Worm The Secret of the Worm He is now fled I suppose to his mad Benefactor and I have not seen him more this Day Of the book there is no more but I have made certain deductions which seem at least probable First that this book was as Mrs Cloris has said the subject of the falling-out between Robert and Philip second that it is a repository of unholy incantation possibly of Druidic origin many of the Druidic blood-rituals were preserved in print by the Roman conquerors of Britain in the name of scholarship and many of these infernal cook-books are among the world s forbidden literature third that Boon and Philip intended to use the book for their own ends Perhaps in some twisted way they intended good but I do not believe it I believe they had long before bound themselves over to whatever faceless powers exist beyond the rim of the Universe powers which may exist beyond the very fabric of Time The last entries of Robert Boone s diary lend a dim glow of approbation to these speculations and I allow them to speak for themselves October A terrific Babble in Preacher s Corners to-day Frawley the Blacksmith seized my Arm and demanded to know What your Brother and that mad Antichrist are into up there Goody Randall claims there have been Signs in the Sky of great impending Disaster A Cow has been born with two Heads As for Myself I know not what impends perhaps tis my Brother s Insanity His Hair has gone Gray almost Overnight his Eyes are great bloodshot Circles from which the pleasing light of Sanity seems to have departed He grins and whispers and for some Reason of his Own has begun to haunt our Cellar when not in Jerusalem s Lot The Whippoorwills congregate about the House and upon the Grass their combined Calling from the Mist blends with the Sea into an unearthly Shriek that precludes all thought of Sleep October Followed P this Evening when he departed for Jerusalem s Lot keeping a safe Distance to avoid Discovery The cursed Whippoorwills flock through the Woods filling all with a deathly psycho-pompotic Chant I dared not cross the Bridge the Town all dark except for the Church which was litten with a ghastly red Glare that seemed to transform the high peak d Windows into the Eyes of the Inferno Voices rose and fell in a Devil s Litany sometimes laughing sometimes sobbing The very Ground seem d to swell and groan beneath me as if it bore an awful Weight and I fled amaz d and full of Terror the hellish screaming Cries of the Whippoorwills dinning in my ears as I ran through those shadow-riven Woods All tends to the Climax yet unforeseen I dare not sleep for the Dreams that come yet not remain awake for what lunatic Terrors may come The night is full of awful Sounds and I fear And yet I feel the urge to go again to watch to see It seems that Philip himself calls me and the old Man The Birds cursed cursed cursed Here the diary of Robert Boone ends Yet you must notice Bones near the conclusion that he claims Philip himself seemed to call him My final conclusion is formed by these lines by the talk of Mrs Cloris and the others but most of all by those terrifying figures in the cellar dead yet alive Our line is yet an unfortunate one Bones There is a curse over us which refuses to be buried it lives a hideous shadow-life in this house and that town And the culmination of the cycle is drawing close again I am the last of the Boone blood I fear that something knows this and that I am at the nexus of an evil endeavor beyond all sane understanding The anniversary is All Saints Eve one week from today How shall I proceed If only you were here to counsel me to help me If only you were here I must know all I must return to the shunned town May God support me CHARLES From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann Oct Mr Boone has slept nearly all this day His face is pallid and much thinner I fear recurrence of his fever is inevitable While refreshing his water carafe I caught sight of two unmailed letters to Mr Granson in Florida He plans to return to Jerusalem s Lot twill be the killing of him if I allow it Dare I steal away to Preacher s Corners and hire a buggy I must and yet what if he wakes If I should return and find him gone The noises have begun in our walls again Thank God he still sleeps My mind shudders from the import of this Later I brought him his dinner on a tray He plans on rising later and despite his evasions I know what he plans yet I go to Preacher s Corners Several of the sleeping-powders prescribed to him during his late illness remained with my things he drank one with his tea all-unknowing He sleeps again To leave him with the Things that shamble behind our walls terrifies me to let him continue even one more day within these walls terrifies me even more greatly I have locked him in God grant he should still be there safe and sleeping when I return with the buggy Still later Stoned me Stoned me like a wild and rabid dog Monsters and fiends These that call themselves men We are prisoners here The birds the whippoorwills have begun to gather October DEAR BONES It is nearly dusk and I have just wakened having slept nearly the last twenty-four hours away Although Cal has said nothing I suspect he put a sleeping-powder in my tea having gleaned my intentions He is a good and faithful friend intending only the best and I shall say nothing Yet my mind is set Tomorrow is the day I am calm resolved but also seem to feel the subtle onset of the fever again If it is so it must be tomorrow Perhaps tonight would be better still yet not even the fires of Hell itself could induce me to set foot in that village by shadowlight Should I write no more may God bless and keep you Bones CHARLES Postscriptum The birds have set up their cry and the horrible shuffling sounds have begun again Cal does not think I hear but I do c From the pocket journal of Calvin McCann Oct AM He is impersuadable Very well I go with him November DEAR BONES Weak yet lucid I am not sure of the date yet my almanac assures me by tide and sunset that it must be correct I sit at my desk where I sat when I first wrote you from Chapelwaite and look out over the dark sea from which the last of the light is rapidly fading I shall never see more This night is my night I leave it for whatever shadows be How it heaves itself at the rocks this sea It throws clouds of sea-foam at the darkling sky in banners making the floor beneath me tremble In the window-glass I see my reflection pallid as any vampire s I have been without nourishment since the twenty- seventh of October and should have been without water had not Calvin left the carafe beside my bed on that day O Cal He is no more Bones He is gone in my place in the place of this wretch with his pipestem arms and skull face who I see reflected back in the darkened glass And yet he may be the more fortunate for no dreams haunt him as they have haunted me these last days twisted shapes that lurk in the nightmare corridors of delirium Even now my hands tremble I have splotched the page with ink Calvin confronted me on that morning just as I was about to slip away and I thinking I had been so crafty I had told him that I had decided we must leave and asked him if he would go to Tandrell some ten miles distant and hire a trap where we were less notorious He agreed to make the hike and I watched him leave by the sea-road When he was out of sight I quickly made myself ready donning both coat and muffler for the weather had turned frosty the first touch of coming winter was on that morning s cutting breeze I wished briefly for a gun then laughed at myself for the wish What avails guns in such a matter I let myself out by the pantry-way pausing for a last look at sea and sky for the smell of the fresh air against the putrescence I knew I should smell soon enough for the sight of a foraging gull wheeling below the clouds I turned and there stood Calvin McCann You shall not go alone said he and his face was as grim as ever I have seen it But Calvin I began No not a word We go together and do what we must or I return you bodily to the house You are not well You shall not go alone It is impossible to describe the conflicting emotions that swept over me confusion pique gratefulness yet the greatest of them was love We made our way silently past the summer house and the sundial down the weed- covered verge and into the woods All was dead still not a bird sang nor a wood-cricket chirruped The world seemed cupped in a silent pall There was only the ever-present smell of salt and from far away the faint tang of woodsmoke The woods were a blazoned riot of colour but to my eye scarlet seemed to predominate all Soon the scent of salt passed and another more sinister odour took its place that rottenness which I have mentioned When we came to the leaning bridge which spanned the Royal I expected Cal to ask me again to defer but he did not He paused looked at that grim spire which seemed to mock the blue sky above it and then looked at me We went on We proceeded with quick yet dread footsteps to James Boon s church The door still hung ajar from our latter exit and the darkness within seemed to leer at us As we mounted the steps brass seemed to fill my heart my hand trembled as it touched the doorhandle and pulled it The smell within was greater more noxious than ever We stepped into the shadowy anteroom and with no pause into the main chamber It was a shambles Something vast had been at work in there and a mighty destruction had taken place Pews were overturned and heaped like jackstraws The wicked cross lay against the east wall and a jagged hole in the plaster above it testified to the force with which it had been hurled The oil-lamps had been ripped from their high fixtures and the reek of whale-oil mingled with the terrible stink which pervaded the town And down the center aisle like a ghastly bridal path was a trail of black ichor mingled with sinister tendrils of blood Our eyes followed it to the pulpit the only untouched thing in view Atop it staring at us from across that blasphemous Book with glazed eyes was the butchered body of a lamb God Calvin whispered We approached keeping clear of the slime on the floor The room echoed back our footsteps and seemed to transmute them into the sound of gigantic laughter We mounted the narthex together The lamb had not been torn or eaten it appeared rather to have been squeezed until its blood-vessels had forcibly ruptured Blood lay in thick and noisome puddles on the lectern itself and about the base of it yet on the book it was transparent and the crabbed runes could be read through it as through coloured glass Must we touch it Cal asked unfaltering Yes I must have it What will you do What should have been done sixty years ago I am going to destroy it We rolled the lamb s corpse away from the book it struck the floor with a hideous lolling thud The blood-stained pages now seemed alive with a scarlet glow of their own My ears began to ring and hum a low chant seemed to emanate from the walls themselves From the twisted look on Cal s face I knew he heard the same The floor beneath us trembled as if the familiar which haunted this church came now unto us to protect its own The fabric of sane space and time seemed to twist and crack the church seemed filled with spectres and litten with the hell-glow of eternal cold fire It seemed that I saw James Boon hideous and misshapen cavorting around the supine body of a woman and my Grand-uncle Philip behind him an acolyte in a black hooded cassock who held a knife and a bowl Deum vobiscum magna vermis The words shuddered and writhed on the page before me soaked in the blood of sacrifice prize of a creature that shambles beyond the stars A blind interbred congregation swaying in mindless daemoniac praise deformed faces filled with hungering nameless anticipation And the Latin was replaced by an older tongue ancient when Egypt was young and the Pyramids unbuilt ancient when this Earth still hung in an unformed boiling firmament of empty gas Gyyagin vardar Yogsoggoth Verminis Gyyagin Gyyaginl Gyyagin The pulpit began to rend and split pushing upward Calvin screamed and lifted an arm to shield his face The narthex trembled with a huge tenebrous motion like a ship wracked in a gale I snatched up the book and held it away from me it seemed filled with the heat of the sun and I felt that I should be cindered blinded Run Calvin screamed Run But I stood frozen and the alien presence filled me like an ancient vessel that had waited for years for generations Gyyagin vardar I screamed Servant of Yogsoggoth the Nameless One The Worm from beyond Space Star-Eater Blinder of Time Verminis Now comes the Hour of Filling the Time of Rending Verminis Alyah Alyah Gyyagin Calvin pushed me and I tottered the church whirling before me and fell to the floor My head crashed against the edge of an upturned pew and red fire filled my head yet seemed to clear it I groped for the sulphur matches I had brought Subterranean thunder filled the place Plaster fell The rusted bell in the steeple pealed a choked devil s carillon in sympathetic vibration My match flared I touched it to the book just as the pulpit exploded upward in a rending explosion of wood A huge black maw was discovered beneath Cal tottered on the edge his hands held out his face distended in a wordless scream that I shall hear forever And then there was a huge surge of gray vibrating flesh The smell became a nightmare tide It was a huge outpouring of a viscid pustulant jelly a huge and awful form that seemed to skyrocket from the very bowels of the ground And yet with a sudden horrible comprehension which no man can have known I perceived that it was but one ring one segment of a monster worm that had existed eyeless for years in the chambered darkness beneath that abominated church The book flared alight in my hands and the Thing seemed to scream soundlessly above me Calvin was stmck glancingly and flung the length of the church like a doll with a broken neck It subsided the thing subsided leaving only a huge and shattered hole surrounded with black slime and a great screaming mewling sound that seemed to fade through colossal distances and was gone I looked down The book was ashes I began to laugh then to howl like a struck beast All sanity left me and I sat on the floor with blood streaming from my temple screaming and gibbering into those unhallowed shadows while Calvin sprawled in the far corner staring at me with glazing horror-struck eyes I have no idea how long I existed in that state It is beyond all telling But when I came again to my faculties shadows had drawn long paths around me and I sat in twilight Movement had caught my eye movement from the shattered hole in the narthex floor A hand groped its way over the riven floorboards My mad laughter choked in my throat All hysteria melted into numb bloodlessness With terrible vengeful slowness a wracked figure pulled itself up from darkness and a half-skull peered at me Beetles crawled over the fleshless forehead A rotted cassock clung to the askew hollows of mouldered collarbones Only the eyes lived red insane pits that glared at me with more than lunacy they glared with the empty life of the pathless wastes beyond the edges of the Universe It came to take me down to darkness That was when I fled screeching leaving the body of my lifelong friend unheeded in that place of dread I ran until the air seemed to burst like magma in my lungs and brain I ran until I had gained this possessed and tainted house again and my room where I collapsed and have lain like a dead man until to-day I ran because even in my crazed state and even in the shattered ruin of that dead-yet-animated shape I had seen the family resemblance Yet not of Philip or of Robert whose likenesses hang in the upstairs gallery That rotted visage belonged to James Boon Keeper of the Worm He still lives somewhere in the twisted lightless wanderings beneath Jerusalem s Lot and Chapelwaite and It still lives The burning of the book thwarted It but there are other copies Yet I am the gateway and I am the last of the Boone blood For the good of all humanity I must die and break the chain forever I go to the sea now Bones My journey like my story is at an end May God rest you and grant you all peace CHARLES The odd series of papers above was eventually received by Mr Everett Granson to whom they had been addressed It is assumed that a recurrence of the unfortunate brain fever which struck him originally following the death of his wife in caused Charles Boone to lose his sanity and murder his companion and longtime friend Mr Calvin McCann The entries in Mr McCann s pocket journal are a fascinating exercise in forgery undoubtedly perpetrated by Charles Boone in an effort to reinforce his own paranoid delusions In at least two particulars however Charles Boone is proved wrong First when the town of Jerusalem s Lot was rediscovered I use the term historically of course the floor of the narthex although rotted showed no sign of explosion or huge damage Although the ancient pews were overturned and several windows shattered this can be assumed to be the work of vandals from neighboring towns over the years Among the older residents of Preacher s Corners and Tandrell there is still some idle rumor about Jerusalem s Lot perhaps in his day it was this kind of harmless folk legend which started Charles Boone s mind on its fatal course but this seems hardly relevant Second Charles Boone was not the last of his line His grandfather Robert Boone sired at least two bastards One died in infancy The second took the Boone name and located in the town of Central Falls Rhode Island I am the final descendant of this offshoot of the Boone line Charles Boone s second cousin removed by three generations These papers have been in my committal for ten years I offer them for publication on the occasion of my residence in the Boone ancestral home Chapelwaite in the hope that the reader will find sympathy in his heart for Charles Boone s poor misguided soul So far as I can tell he was correct about only one thing this place badly needs the services of an exterminator There are some huge rats in the walls by the sound Signed James Robert Boone October GRAVEYARD SHIFT Two a m Friday Hall was sitting on the bench by the elevator the only place on the third floor where a working joe could catch a smoke when Warwick came up He wasn t happy to see Warwick The foreman wasn t supposed to show up on three during the graveyard shift he was supposed to stay down in his office in the basement drinking coffee from the urn that stood on the corner of his desk Besides it was hot It was the hottest June on record in Gates Falls and the Orange Cmsh thermometer which was also by the elevator had once rested at degrees at three in the morning God only knew what kind of hellhole the mill was on the three-to-eleven shift Hall worked the picker machine a balky gadget manufactured by a defunct Cleveland firm in He had only been working in the mill since April which meant he was still making minimum an hour which was still all right No wife no steady girl no alimony He was a drifter and during the last three years he had moved on his thumb from Berkeley college student to Lake Tahoe busboy to Galveston stevedore to Miami short-order cook to Wheeling taxi driver and dish-washer to Gates Falls Maine picker-machine operator He didn t figure on moving again until the snow fell He was a solitary person and he liked the hours from eleven to seven when the blood flow of the big mill was at its coolest not to mention the temperature The only thing he did not like was the rats The third floor was long and deserted lit only by the sputtering glow of the fluorescents Unlike the other levels of the mill it was relatively silent and unoccupied at least by the humans The rats were another matter The only machine on three was the picker the rest of the floor was storage for the ninety-pound bags of fiber which had yet to be sorted by Hall s long gear-toothed machine They were stacked like link sausages in long rows some of them especially the discontinued meltons and irregular slipes for which there were no orders years old and dirty gray with industrial wastes They made fine nesting places for the rats huge fat-bellied creatures with rabid eyes and bodies that jumped with lice and vermin Hall had developed a habit of collecting a small arsenal of soft-drink cans from the trash barrel during his break He pegged them at the rats during times when work was slow retrieving them later at his leisure Only this time Mr Foreman had caught him coming up the stairs instead of using the elevator like the sneaky sonofabitch everyone said he was What are you up to Hall The rats Hall said realizing how lame that must sound now that all the rats had snuggled safely back into their houses I peg cans at em when I see em Warwick nodded once briefly He was a big beefy man with a crew cut His shirtsleeves were rolled up and his tie was pulled down He looked at Hall closely We don t pay you to chuck cans at rats mister Not even if you pick them up again Harry hasn t sent down an order for twenty minutes Hall answered thinking Why couldn t you stay the hell put and drink your coffee I can t run it through the picker if I don t have it Warwick nodded as if the topic no longer interested him Maybe I ll take a walk up and see Wisconsky he said Five to one he s reading a magazine while the crap piles up in his bins Hall didn t say anything Warwick suddenly pointed There s one Get the bastard Hall fired the Nehi can he had been holding with one whistling overhand motion The rat which had been watching them from atop one of the fabric bags with its bright buckshot eyes fled with one faint squeak Warwick threw back his head and laughed as Hall went after the can I came to see you about something else Warwick said Is that so Next week s Fourth of July week Hall nodded The mill would be shut down Monday to Saturday vacation week for men with at least one year s tenure Layoff week for men with less than a year You want to work Hall shrugged Doing what We re going to clean the whole basement level Nobody s touched it for twelve years Helluva mess We re going to use hoses The town zoning committee getting on the board of directors Warwick looked steadily at Hall You want it or not Two an hour double time on the fourth We re working the graveyard shift because it ll be cooler Hall calculated He could clear maybe seventy-five bucks after taxes Better than the goose egg he had been looking forward to All right Report down by the dye house next Monday Hall watched him as he started back to the stairs Warwick paused halfway there and turned back to look at Hall You used to be a college boy didn t you Hall nodded Okay college boy I m keeping it in mind He left Hall sat down and lit another smoke holding a soda can in one hand and watching for the rats He could just imagine how it would be in the basement the sub basement actually a level below the dye house Damp dark full of spiders and rotten cloth and ooze from the river and rats Maybe even bats the aviators of the rodent family Gah Hall threw the can hard then smiled thinly to himself as the faint sound of Warwick s voice came down through the overhead ducts reading Harry Wisconsky the riot act Okay college boy I m keeping it in mind He stopped smiling abruptly and butted his smoke A few moments later Wisconsky started to send rough nylon down through the blowers and Hall went to work And after a while the rats came out and sat atop the bags at the back of the long room watching him with their unblinking black eyes They looked like a jury Eleven p m Monday There were about thirty-six men sitting around when Warwick came in wearing a pair of old jeans tucked into high rubber boots Hall had been listening to Harry Wisconsky who was enormously fat enormously lazy and enormously gloomy It s gonna be a mess Wisconsky was saying when Mr Foreman came in You wait and see we re all gonna go home blacker n midnight in Persia Okay Warwick said We strung sixty lightbulbs down there so it should be bright enough for you to see what you re doing You guys he pointed to a bunch of men that had been leaning against the drying spools want you to hook up the hoses over there to the main water conduit by the stairwell You can unroll them down the stairs We got about eighty yards for each man and that should be plenty Don t get cute and spray one of your buddies or you ll send him to the hospital They pack a wallop Somebody ll get hurt Wisconsky prophesied sourly Wait and see You other guys Warwick said pointing to the group that Hall and Wisconsky were a part of You re the crap crew tonight You go in pairs with an electric wagon for each team There s old office furniture bags of cloth hunks of busted machinery you name it We re gonna pile it by the airshaft at the west end Anyone who doesn t know how to run a wagon No one raised a hand The electric wagons were battery-driven contraptions like miniature dump trucks They developed a nauseating stink after continual use that reminded Hall of burning power lines Okay Warwick said We got the basement divided up into sections and we ll be done by Thursday Friday we ll chain-hoist the crap out Questions There were none Hall studied the foreman s face closely and he had a sudden premonition of a strange thing coming The idea pleased him He did not like Warwick very much Fine Warwick said Fet s get at it Two a m Tuesday Hall was bushed and very tired of listening to Wisconsky s steady patter of profane complaints He wondered if it would do any good to belt Wisconsky He doubted it It would just give Wisconsky something else to bitch about Hall had known it would be bad but this was murder For one thing he hadn t anticipated the smell The polluted stink of the river mixed with the odor of decaying fabric rotting masonry vegetable matter In the far corner where they had begun Hall discovered a colony of huge white toadstools poking their way up through the shattered cement His hands had come in contact with them as he pulled and yanked at a rusty gear toothed wheel and they felt curiously warm and bloated like the flesh of a man afflicted with dropsy The bulbs couldn t banish the twelve-year darkness it could only push it back a little and cast a sickly yellow glow over the whole mess The place looked like the shattered nave of a desecrated church with its high ceiling and mammoth discarded machinery that they would never be able to move its wet walls overgrown with patches of yellow moss and the atonal choir that was the water from the hoses running in the half-clogged sewer network that eventually emptied into the river below the falls And the rats huge ones that made those on third look like dwarfs God knew what they were eating down here They were continually overturning boards and bags to reveal huge nests of shredded newspaper watching with atavistic loathing as the pups fled into the cracks and crannies their eyes huge and blind with the continuous darkness Let s stop for a smoke Wisconsky said He sounded out of breath but Hall had no idea why he had been goldbricking all night Still it was about that time and they were currently out of sight of everyone else All right He leaned against the edge of the electric wagon and lit up I never should ve let Warwick talk me into this Wisconsky said dolefuly This ain t work for a man But he was mad the other night when he caught me in the crapper up on four with my pants up Christ was he mad Hall said nothing He was thinking about Warwick and about the rats Strange how the two things seemed tied together The rats seemed to have forgotten all about men in their long stay under the mill they were impudent and hardly afraid at all One of them had sat up on its hind legs like a squirrel until Hall had gotten in kicking distance and then it had launched itself at his boot biting at the leather Hundreds maybe thousands He wondered how many varieties of disease they were carrying around in this black sumphole And Warwick Something about him I need the money Wisconsky said But Christ Jesus buddy this ain t no work for a man Those rats He looked around fearfully It almost seems like they think You ever wonder how it d be if we was little and they were big Oh shut up Hall said Wisconsky looked at him wounded Say I m sorry buddy It s just that He trailed off Jesus this place stinks he cried This ain t no kind of work for a man A spider crawled off the edge of the wagon and scrambled up his arm He brushed it off with a choked sound of disgust Come on Hall said snuffing his cigarette The faster the quicker I suppose Wisconsky said miserably I suppose Four a m Tuesday Lunch time Hall and Wisconsky sat with three or four other men eating their sandwiches with black hands that not even the industrial detergent could clean Hall ate looking into the foreman s little glass office Warwick was drinking coffee and eating cold hamburgers with great relish Ray Upson had to go home Charlie Brochu said He puke someone asked I almost did Nuh Ray d eat cowflop before he d puke Rat bit him Hall looked up thoughtfully from his examination of Warwick Is that so he asked Yeah Brochu shook his head I was teaming with him Goddamndest thing I ever saw Jumped out of a hole in one of those old cloth bags Must have been big as a cat Grabbed onto his hand and started chewing Jee-sus one of the men said looking green Yeah Brochu said Ray screamed just like a woman and I ain t blamin him He bled like a pig Would that thing let go No sir I had to belt it three or four times with a board before it would Ray was just about crazy He stomped it until it wasn t nothing but a mess of fur Damndest thing I ever saw Warwick put a bandage on him and sent him home Told him to go to the doctor tomorrow That was big of the bastard somebody said As if he had heard Warwick got to his feet in his office stretched and then came to the door Time we got back with it The men got to their feet slowly eating up all the time they possibly could stowing their dinner buckets getting cold drinks buying candy bars Then they started down heels clanking dispiritedly on the steel grillwork of the stair risers Warwick passed Hall clapping him on the shoulder How s it going college boy He didn t wait for an answer Come on Hall said patiently to Wisconsky who was tying his shoelace They went downstairs Seven a m Tuesday Hall and Wisconsky walked out together it seemed to Hall that he had somehow inherited the fat Pole Wisconsky was almost comically dirty his fat moon face smeared like that of a small boy who has just been thrashed by the town bully There was none of the usual rough banter from the other men the pulling of shirttails the cracks about who was keeping Tony s wife warm between the hours of one and four Nothing but silence and an occasional hawking sound as someone spat on the dirty floor You want a lift Wisconsky asked him hesitantly Thanks They didn t talk as they rode up Mill Street and crossed the bridge They exchanged only a brief word when Wisconsky dropped him off in front of his apartment Hall went directly to the shower still thinking about Warwick trying to place whatever it was about Mr Foreman that drew him made him feel that somehow they had become tied together He slept as soon as his head hit the pillow but his sleep was broken and restless he dreamed of rats One a m Wednesday It was better running the hoses They couldn t go in until the crap crews had finished a section and quite often they were done hosing before the next section was clear which meant time for a cigarette Hall worked the nozzle of one of the long hoses and Wisconsky pattered back and forth unsnagging lengths of the hose turning the water on and off moving obstructions Warwick was short-tempered because the work was proceeding slowly They would never be done by Thursday the way things were going Now they were working on a helter-skelter jumble of nineteenth-century office equipment that had been piled in one corner smashed rolltop desks moldy ledgers reams of invoices chairs with broken seats and it was rat heaven Scores of them squeaked and ran through the dark and crazy passages that honeycombed the heap and after two men were bitten the others refused to work until Warwick sent someone upstairs to get heavy rubberized gloves the kind usually reserved for the dye-house crew which had to work with acids Hall and Wisconsky were waiting to go in with their hoses when a sandy-haired bullneck named Carmichael began howling curses and backing away slapping at his chest with his gloved hands A huge rat with gray-streaked fur and ugly glaring eyes had bitten into his shirt and hung there squeaking and kicking at Carmichael s belly with its back paws Carmichael finally knocked it away with his fist but there was a huge hole in his shirt and a thin line of blood trickled from above one nipple The anger faded from his face He turned away and retched Hall turned the hose on the rat which was old and moving slowly a snatch of Carmichael s shirt still caught in its jaws The roaring pressure drove it backward against the wall where it smashed limply Warwick came over an odd strained smile on his lips He clapped Hall on the shoulder Damn sight better than throwing cans at the little bastards huh college boy Some little bastard Wisconsky said It s a foot long Turn that hose over there Warwick pointed at the jumble of furniture You guys get out of the way With pleasure someone muttered Carmichael charged up to Warwick his face sick and twisted I m gonna have compensation for this I m gonna Sure Warwick said smiling You got bit on the titty Get out of the way before you get pasted down by this water Hall pointed the nozzle and let it go It hit with a white explosion of spray knocking over a desk and smashing two chairs to splinters Rats ran everywhere bigger than any Hall had ever seen He could hear men crying out in disgust and horror as they fled things with huge eyes and sleek plump bodies He caught a glimpse of one that looked as big as a healthy six-week puppy He kept on until he could see no more then shut the nozzle down Okay Warwick called Let s pick it up I didn t hire out as no exterminator Cy Ippeston called mutinously Hall had tipped a few with him the week before He was a young guy wearing a smut-stained baseball cap and a T-shirt That you Ippeston Warwick asked genially Ippeston looked uncertain but stepped forward Yeah I don t want no more of these rats I hired to clean up not to maybe get rabies or typhoid or somethin Maybe you best count me out There was a murmur of agreement from the others Wisconsky stole a look at Hall but Hall was examining the nozzle of the hose he was holding It had a bore like a and could probably knock a man twenty feet You saying you want to punch your clock Cy Thinkin about it Ippeston said Warwick nodded Okay You and anybody else that wants But this ain t no unionized shop and never has been Punch out now and you ll never punch back in I ll see to it Aren t you some hot ticket Hall muttered Warwick swung around Did you say something college boy Hall regarded him blandly Just clearing my throat Mr Foreman Warwick smiled Something taste bad to you Hall said nothing All right let s pick it up Warwick bawled They went back to work Two a m Thursday Hall and Wisconsky were working with the trucks again picking up junk The pile by the west airshaft had grown to amazing proportions but they were still not half done Happy Fourth Wisconsky said when they stopped for a smoke They were working near the north wall far from the stairs The light was extremely dim and some trick of acoustics made the other men seem miles away Thanks Hall dragged on his smoke Haven t seen many rats tonight Nobody has Wisconsky said Maybe they got wise They were standing at the end of a crazy zigzagging alley formed by piles of old ledgers and invoices moldy bags of cloth and two huge flat looms of ancient vintage Gah Wisconsky said spitting That Warwick Where do you suppose all the rats got to Hall asked almost to himself Not into the walls He looked at the wet and crumbling masonry that surrounded the huge foundation stones They d drown The river s saturated everything Something black and flapping suddenly dive-bombed them Wisconsky screamed and put his hands over his head A bat Hall said watching after it as Wisconsky straightened up A bat A bat Wisconsky raved What s a bat doing in the cellar They re supposed to be in trees and under eaves and It was a big one Hall said softly And what s a bat but a rat with wings Jesus Wisconsky moaned How did it Get in Maybe the same way the rats got out What s going on back there Warwick shouted from somewhere behind them Where are you Don t sweat it Hall said softly His eyes gleamed in the dark Was that you college boy Warwick called He sounded closer It s okay Hall yelled I barked my shin Warwick s short barking laugh You want a Purple Heart Wisconsky looked at Hall Why d you say that Look Hall knelt and lit a match There was a square in the middle of the wet and crumbling cement Tap it Wisconsky did It s wood Hall nodded It s the top of a support I ve seen some other ones around here There s another level under this part of the basement God Wisconsky said with utter revulsion Three-thirty a m Thursday They were in the northeast corner Ippeston and Brochu behind them with one of the high-pressure hoses when Hall stopped and pointed at the floor There I thought we d come across it There was a wooden trapdoor with a crusted iron ringbolt set near the center He walked back to Ippeston and said Shut it off for a minute When the hose was choked to a trickle he raised his voice to a shout Hey Hey Warwick Better come here a minute Warwick came splashing over looking at Hall with that same hard smile in his eyes Your shoelace come untied college boy Look Hall said He kicked the trapdoor with his foot Sub-cellar So what Warwick asked This isn t break time col That s where your rats are Hall said They re breeding down there Wisconsky and I even saw a bat earlier Some of the other men had gathered around and were looking at the trapdoor I don t care Warwick said The job was the basement not You ll need about twenty exterminators trained ones Hall was saying Going to cost the management a pretty penny Too bad Someone laughed Fat chance Warwick looked at Hall as if he were a bug under glass You re really a case you are he said sounding fascinated Do you think I give a good goddamn how many rats there are under there I was at the library this afternoon and yesterday Hall said Good thing you kept reminding me I was a college boy I read the town zoning ordinances Warwick they were set up in before this mill got big enough to co-opt the zoning board Know what I found Warwick s eyes were cold Take a walk college boy You re fired I found out Hall plowed on as if he hadn t heard I found out that there is a zoning law in Gates Falls about vermin You spell that v-e-r-m-i-n in case you wondered It means disease-carrying animals such as bats skunks unlicensed dogs and rats Especially rats Rats are mentioned fourteen times in two paragraphs Mr Foreman So you just keep in mind that the minute I punch out I m going straight to the town commissioner and tell him what the situation down here is He paused relishing Warwick s hate-congested face I think that between me him and the town committee we can get an injunction slapped on this place You re going to be shut down a lot longer than just Saturday Mr Foreman And I got a good idea what your boss is going to say when he turns up Hope your unemployment insurance is paid up Warwick Warwick s hands formed into claws You damned snot-nose I ought to He looked down at the trapdoor and suddenly his smile reappeared Consider yourself rehired college boy I thought you might see the light Warwick nodded the same strange grin on his face You re just so smart I think maybe you ought to go down there Hall so we got somebody with a college education to give us an informed opinion You and Wisconsky Not me Wisconsky exclaimed Not me I Warwick looked at him You what Wisconsky shut up Good Hall said cheerfully We ll need three flashlights I think I saw a whole rack of those six-battery jobs in the main office didn t I You want to take somebody else Warwick asked expansively Sure pick your man You Hall said gently The strange expression had come into his face again After all the management should be represented don t you think Just so Wisconsky and I don t see too many rats down there Someone it sounded like Ippeston laughed loudly Warwick looked at the men carefully They studied the tips of their shoes Finally he pointed at Brochu Brochu go up to the office and get three flashlights Tell the watchman I said to let you in Why d you get me into this Wisconsky moaned to Hall You know I hate those It wasn t me Hall said and looked at Warwick Warwick looked back at him and neither would drop his eyes Four a m Thursday Brochu returned with the flashlights He gave one to Hall one to Wisconsky one to Warwick Ippeston Give the hose to Wisconsky Ippeston did so The nozzle trembled delicately between the Pole s hands All right Warwick said to Wisconsky You re in the middle If there are rats you let them have it Sure Hall thought And if there are rats Warwick won t see them And neither will Wisconsky after he finds an extra ten in his pay envelope Warwick pointed at two of the men Lift it One of them bent over the ringbolt and pulled For a moment Hall didn t think it was going to give and then it yanked free with an odd crunching snap The other man put his fingers on the underside to help pull then withdrew with a cry His hands were crawling with huge and sightless beetles With a convulsive grunt the man on the ringbolt pulled the trap back and let it drop The underside was black with an odd fungus that Hall had never seen before The beetles dropped off into the darkness below or ran across the floor to be crushed Look Hall said There was a rusty lock bolted on the underside now broken But it shouldn t be underneath Warwick said It should be on top Why Lots of reasons Hall said Maybe so nothing on this side could open it at least when the lock was new Maybe so nothing on that side could get up But who locked it Wisconsky asked Ah Hall said mockingly looking at Warwick A mystery Listen Brochu whispered Oh God Wisconsky sobbed I ain t going down there It was a soft sound almost expectant the whisk and patter of thousands of paws the squeaking of rats Could be frogs Warwick said Hall laughed aloud Warwick shone his light down A sagging flight of wooden stairs led down to the black stones of the floor beneath There was not a rat in sight Those stairs won t hold us Warwick said with finality Brochu took two steps forward and jumped up and down on the first step It creaked but showed no sign of giving way I didn t ask you to do that Warwick said You weren t there when that rat bit Ray Brochu said softly Let s go Hall said Warwick took a last sardonic look around at the circle of men then walked to the edge with Hall Wisconsky stepped reluctantly between them They went down one at a time Hall then Wisconsky then Warwick Their flashlight beams played over the floor which was twisted and heaved into a hundred crazy hills and valleys The hose thumped along behind Wisconsky like a clumsy serpent When they got to the bottom Warwick flashed his light around It picked out a few rotting boxes some barrels little else The seep from the river stood in puddles that came to ankle depth on their boots I don t hear them anymore Wisconsky whispered They walked slowly away from the trapdoor their feet shuffling through the slime Hall paused and shone his light on a huge wooden box with white letters on it Elias Varney he read Was the mill here then No Warwick said It wasn t built until What difference Hall didn t answer They walked forward again The sub-cellar was longer than it should have been it seemed The stench was stronger a smell of decay and rot and things buried And still the only sound was the faint cavelike drip of water What s that Hall asked pointing his beam at a jut of concrete that protruded perhaps two feet into the cellar Beyond it the darkness continued and it seemed to Hall that he could now hear sounds up there curiously stealthy Warwick peered at it It s no that can t be right Outer wall of the mill isn t it And up ahead I m going back Warwick said suddenly turning around Hall grabbed his neck roughly You re not going anywhere Mr Foreman Warwick looked up at him his grin cutting the darkness You re crazy college boy Isn t that right Crazy as a loon You shouldn t push people friend Keep going Wisconsky moaned Hall Give me that Hall grabbed the hose He let go of Warwick s neck and pointed the hose at his head Wisconsky turned abruptly and crashed back toward the trapdoor Hall did not even turn After you Mr Foreman Warwick stepped forward walking under the place where the mill ended above them Hall flashed his light about and felt a cold satisfaction premonition fulfilled The rats had closed in around them silent as death Crowded in rank on rank Thousands of eyes looked greedily back at him In ranks to the wall some fully as high as a man s shin Warwick saw them a moment later and came to a full stop They re all around us college boy His voice was still calm still in control but it held a jagged edge Yes Hall said Keep going They walked forward the hose dragging behind Hall looked back once and saw the rats had closed the aisle behind them and were gnawing at the heavy canvas hosing One looked up and almost seemed to grin at him before lowering his head again He could see the bats now too They were roosting from the roughhewn overheads huge the size of crows or rooks Took Warwick said centering his beam about five feet ahead A skull green with mold laughed up at them Further on Hall could see an ulna one pelvic wing part of a ribcage Keep going Hall said He felt something bursting up inside him something lunatic and dark with colors You are going to break before I do Mr Foreman so help me God They walked past the bones The rats were not crowding them their distances appeared constant Up ahead Hall saw one cross their path of travel Shadows hid it but he caught sight of a pink twitching tail as thick as a telephone cord Up ahead the flooring rose sharply then dipped Hall could hear a stealthy rustling sound a big sound Something that perhaps no living man had ever seen It occurred to Hall that he had perhaps been looking for something like this through all his days of crazy wandering The rats were moving in creeping on their bellies forcing them forward Look Warwick said coldly Hall saw Something had happened to the rats back here some hideous mutation that never could have survived under the eye of the sun nature would have forbidden it But down here nature had taken on another ghastly face The rats were gigantic some as high as three feet But their rear legs were gone and they were blind as moles like their flying cousins They dragged themselves forward with hideous eagerness Warwick turned and faced Hall the smile hanging on by brute willpower Hall really had to admire him We can t go on Hall You must see that The rats have business with you I think Hall said Warwick s control slipped Please he said Please Hall smiled Keep going Warwick was looking over his shoulder They re gnawing into the hose When they get through it we ll never get back I know Keep going You re insane A rat ran across Warwick s shoe and he screamed Hall smiled and gestured with his light They were all around the closest of them less than a foot away now Warwick began to walk again The rats drew back They topped the miniature rise and looked down Warwick reached it first and Hall saw his face go white as paper Spit ran down his chin Oh my God Dear Jesus And he turned to run Hall opened the nozzle of the hose and the high-pressure rush of water struck Warwick squarely on the chest knocking him back out of sight There was a long scream that rose over the sound of the water Thrashing sounds Hall Grunts A huge tenebrous squeaking that seemed to fill the earth HALL FOR GOD S SAKE A sudden wet ripping noise Another scream weaker Something huge shifted and turned Quite distinctly Hall heard the wet snap that a fractured bone makes A legless rat guided by some bastard form of sonar lunged against him biting Its body was flabby warm Almost absently Hall turned the hose on it knocking it away The hose did not have quite so much pressure now Hall walked to the brow of the wet hill and looked down The rat filled the whole gully at the far end of that noxious tomb It was a huge and pulsating gray eyeless totally without legs When Hall s light struck it it made a hideous mewling noise Their queen then the magna mater A huge and nameless thing whose progeny might someday develop wings It seemed to dwarf what remained of Warwick but that was probably just illusion It was the shock of seeing a rat as big as a Holstein calf Goodbye Warwick Hall said The rat crouched over Mr Foreman jealously ripping at one limp arm Hall turned away and began to make his way back rapidly halting the rats with his hose which was growing less and less potent Some of them got through and attacked his legs above the tops of his boots with biting lunges One hung stubbornly on at his thigh ripping at the cloth of his corduroy pants Hall made a fist and smashed it aside He was nearly three-quarters of the way back when the huge whirring filled the darkness He looked up and the gigantic flying form smashed into his face The mutated bats had not lost their tails yet It whipped around Hall s neck in a loathsome coil and squeezed as the teeth sought the soft spot under his neck It wriggled and flapped with its membranous wings clutching the tatters of his shirt for purchase Hall brought the nozzle of the hose up blindly and struck at its yielding body again and again It fell away and he trampled it beneath his feet dimly aware that he was screaming The rats ran in a flood over his feet up his legs He broke into a staggering run shaking some off The others bit at his belly his chest One ran up his shoulder and pressed its questing muzzle into the cup of his ear He ran into the second bat It roosted on his head for a moment squealing and then ripped away a flap of Hall s scalp He felt his body growing numb His ears filled with the screech and yammer of many rats He gave one last heave stumbled over furry bodies fell to his knees He began to laugh a high screaming sound Five a m Thursday Somebody better go down there Brochu said tentatively Not me Wisconsky whispered Not me No not you jelly belly Ippeston said with contempt Well let s go Brogan said bringing up another hose Me Ippeston Dangerfield Nedeau Stevenson go up to the office and get a few more lights Ippeston looked down into the darkness thoughtfully Maybe they stopped for a smoke he said A few rats what the hell Stevenson came back with the lights a few moments later they started down NIGHT SURF After the guy was dead and the smell of his burning flesh was off the air we all went back down to the beach Corey had his radio one of those suitcase-sized transistor jobs that take about forty batteries and also make and play tapes You couldn t say the sound reproduction was great but it sure was loud Corey had been well-to-do before A but stuff like that didn t matter anymore Even his big radio tape-player was hardly more than a nice-looking hunk of junk There were only two radio stations left on the air that we could get One was WKDM in Portsmouth some backwoods deejay who had gone nutty- religious He d play a Perry Como record say a prayer bawl play a Johnny Ray record read from Psalms complete with each selah just like James Dean in East of Eden then bawl some more Happy-time stuff like that One day he sang Bringing in the Sheaves in a cracked moldy voice that sent Needles and me into hysterics The Massachusetts station was better but we could only get it at night It was a bunch of kids I guess they took over the transmitting facilities of WRKO or WBZ after everybody left or died They only gave gag call letters like WDOPE or KUNT or WA or stuff like that Really funny you know you could die laughing That was the one we were listening to on the way back to the beach I was holding hands with Susie Kelly and Joan were ahead of us and Needles was already over the brow of the point and out of sight Corey was bringing up the rear swinging his radio The Stones were singing Angie Do you love me Susie was asking That s all I want to know do you love me Susie needed constant reassurance I was her teddy bear No I said She was getting fat and if she lived long enough which wasn t likely she would get really flabby She was already mouthy You re rotten she said and put a hand to her face Her lacquered fingernails twinkled dimly with the half-moon that had risen about an hour ago Are you going to cry again Shut up She sounded like she was going to cry again all right We came over the ridge and I paused I always have to pause Before A this had been a public beach Tourists picnickers runny-nosed kids and fat baggy grandmothers with sunburned elbows Candy wrappers and popsicle sticks in the sand all the beautiful people necking on their beach blankets intermingled stench of exhaust from the parking lot seaweed and Coppertone oil But now all the dirt and all the crap was gone The ocean had eaten it all of it as casually as you might eat a handful of Cracker Jacks There were no people to come back and dirty it again Just us and we weren t enough to make much mess We loved the beach too I guess hadn t we just offered it a kind of sacrifice Even Susie little bitch Susie with her fat ass and her cranberry bellbottoms The sand was white and duned marked only by the high-tide line twisted skein of seaweed kelp hunks of driftwood The moonlight stitched inky crescent-shaped shadows and folds across everything The deserted lifeguard tower stood white and skeletal some fifty yards from the bathhouse pointing toward the sky like a finger bone And the surf the night surf throwing up great bursts of foam breaking against the headlands for as far as we could see in endless attacks Maybe that water had been halfway to England the night before Angie by the Stones the cracked voice on Corey s radio said I m sureya dug that one a blast from the past that s a golden gas straight from the grooveyard a platta that mattas I m Bobby This was supposed to be Fred s night but Fred got the flu He s all swelled up Susie giggled then with the first tears still on her eyelashes I started toward the beach a little faster to keep her quiet Wait up Corey called Bernie Hey Bernie wait up The guy on the radio was reading some dirty limericks and a girl in the background asked him where did he put the beer He said something back but by that time we were on the beach I looked back to see how Corey was doing He was coming down on his backside as usual and he looked so ludicrous I felt a little sorry for him Run with me I said to Susie Why I slapped her on the can and she squealed Just because it feels good to run We ran She fell behind panting like a horse and calling for me to slow down but I put her out of my head The wind rushed past my ears and blew the hair off my forehead I could smell the salt in the air sharp and tart The surf pounded The waves were like foamed black glass I kicked off my rubber sandals and pounded across the sand barefoot not minding the sharp digs of an occasional shell My blood roared And then there was the lean-to with Needles already inside and Kelly and Joan standing beside it holding hands and looking at the water I did a forward roll feeling sand go down the back of my shirt and fetched up against Kelly s legs He fell on top of me and mbbed my face in the sand while Joan laughed We got up and grinned at each other Susie had given up running and was plodding toward us Corey had almost caught up to her Some fire Kelly said Do you think he came all the way from New York like he said Joan asked I don t know I couldn t see that it mattered anyway He had been behind the wheel of a big Lincoln when we found him semi-conscious and raving His head was bloated to the size of a football and his neck looked like a sausage He had Captain Trips and not far to go either So we took him up to the Point that overlooks the beach and burned him He said his name was Alvin Sackheim He kept calling for his grandmother He thought Susie was his grandmother This struck her funny God knows why The strangest things strike Susie funny It was Corey s idea to burn him up but it started off as a joke He had read all those books about witchcraft and black magic at college and he kept leering at us in the dark beside Alvin Sackheim s Lincoln and telling us that if we made a sacrifice to the dark gods maybe the spirits would keep protecting us against A Of course none of us really believed that bullshit but the talk got more and more serious It was a new thing to do and finally we went ahead and did it We tied him to the observation gadget up there you put a dime in it and on a clear day you can see all the way to Portland Headlight We tied him with our belts and then we went rooting around for dry brush and hunks of driftwood like kids playing a new kind of hide-and-seek All the time we were doing it Alvin Sackheim just sort of leaned there and mumbled to his grandmother Susie s eyes got very bright and she was breathing fast It was really turning her on When we were down in the ravine on the other side of the outcrop she leaned against me and kissed me She was wearing too much lipstick and it was like kissing a greasy plate I pushed her away and that was when she started pouting We went back up all of us and piled dead branches and twigs up to Alvin Sackheim s waist Needles lit the pyre with his Zippo and it went up fast At the end just before his hair caught on fire the guy began to scream There was a smell just like sweet Chinese pork Got a cigarette Bernie Needles asked There s about fifty cartons right behind you He grinned and slapped a mosquito that was probing his arm Don t want to move I gave him a smoke and sat down Susie and I met Needles in Portland He was sitting on the curb in front of the State Theater playing Leadbelly tunes on a big old Gibson guitar he had looted someplace The sound had echoed up and down Congress Street as if he were playing in a concert hall Susie stopped in front of us still out of breath You re rotten Bernie Come on Sue Turn the record over That side stinks Bastard Stupid unfeeling son of a bitch Creep Go away I said or I ll black your eye Susie See if I don t She started to cry again She was really good at it Corey came up and tried to put an arm around her She elbowed him in the crotch and he spit in her face I ll kill you She came at him screaming and weeping making propellers with her hands Corey backed off almost fell then turned tail and ran Susie followed him hurling hysterical obscenities Needles put back his head and laughed The sound of Corey s radio came back to us faintly over the surf Kelly and Joan had wandered off I could see them down by the edge of the water walking with their arms around each other s waist They looked like an ad in a travel agent s window Fly to Beautiful St Lorca It was all right They had a good thing Bernie What I sat and smoked and thought about Needles flipping back the top of his Zippo spinning the wheel making fire with flint and steel like a caveman I ve got it Needles said Yeah I looked at him Are you sure Sure I am My head aches My stomach aches Hurts to piss Maybe it s just Hong Kong flu Susie had Hong Kong flu She wanted a Bible I laughed That had been while we were still at the University about a week before they closed it down for good a month before they started carrying bodies away in dump trucks and burying them in mass graves with payloaders Look He lit a match and held it under the angle of his jaw I could see the first triangular smudges the first swelling It was A all right Okay I said I don t feel so bad he said In my mind I mean You though You think about it a lot I can tell No I don t A lie Sure you do Like that guy tonight You re thinking about that too We probably did him a favor when you get right down to it I don t think he even knew it was happening He knew He shrugged and turned on his side It doesn t matter We smoked and I watched the surf come in and go out Needles had Captain Trips That made everything real all over again It was late August already and in a couple of weeks the first chill of fall would be creeping in Time to move inside someplace Winter Dead by Christmas maybe all of us In somebody s front room with Corey s expensive radio tape-player on top of a bookcase full of Reader s Digest Condensed Books and the weak winter sun lying on the rug in meaningless windowpane patterns The vision was clear enough to make me shudder Nobody should think about winter in August It s like a goose walking over your grave Needles laughed See You do think about it What could I say I stood up Going to look for Susie Maybe we re the last people on earth Bernie Did you ever think of that In the faint moonlight he already looked half dead with circles under his eyes and pallid unmoving fingers like pencils I walked down to the water and looked out across it There was nothing to see but the restless moving humps of the waves topped by delicate curls of foam The thunder of the breakers was tremendous down here bigger than the world Like standing inside a thunderstorm I closed my eyes and rocked on my bare feet The sand was cold and damp and packed And if we were the last people on earth so what This would go on as long as there was a moon to pull the water Susie and Corey were up the beach Susie was riding him as if he were a bucking bronc pounding his head into the running boil of the water Corey was flailing and splashing They were both soaked I walked down and pushed her off with my foot Corey splashed away on all fours spluttering and whoofing I hate you Susie screamed at me Her mouth was a dark grinning crescent It looked like the entrance to a fun house When I was a kid my mother used to take us kids to Harrison State Park and there was a fun house with a big clown face on the front and you walked in through the mouth Come on Susie Up Fido I held out my hand She took it doubtfully and stood up There was damp sand clotted on her blouse and skin You didn t have to push me Bernie You don t ever Come on She wasn t like a jukebox you never had to put in a dime and she never came unplugged We walked up the beach toward the main concession The man who ran the place had had a small overhead apartment There was a bed She didn t really deserve a bed but Needles was right about that It didn t matter No one was really scoring the game anymore The stairs went up the side of the building but I paused for just a minute to look in the broken window at the dusty wares inside that no one had cared enough about to loot stacks of sweatshirts Anson Beach and a picture of sky and waves printed on the front glittering bracelets that would green the wrist on the second day bright junk earrings beachballs dirty greeting cards badly painted ceramic madonnas plastic vomit So realistic Try it on your wife Fourth of July sparklers for a Fourth that never was beach towels with a voluptuous girl in a bikini standing amid the names of a hundred famous resort areas pennants Souvenir of Anson Beach and Park balloons bathing suits There was a snack bar up front with a big sign saying try our clam cake special I used to come to Anson Beach a lot when I was still in high school That was seven years before A and I was going with a girl named Maureen She was a big girl She had a pink checked bathing suit I used to tell her it looked like a tablecloth We had walked along the boardwalk in front of this place barefoot the boards hot and sandy beneath our heels We had never tried the clam cake special What are you looking at Nothing Come on I had sweaty ugly dreams about Alvin Sackheim He was propped behind the wheel of his shiny yellow Lincoln talking about his grandmother He was nothing but a bloated blackened head and a charred skeleton He smelled burnt He talked on and on and after a while I couldn t make out a single word I woke up breathing hard Susie was sprawled across my thighs pale and bloated My watch said but it had stopped It was still dark out The surf pounded and smashed High tide Make it Light soon I got out of bed and went to the doorway The sea breeze felt fine against my hot body In spite of it all I didn t want to die I went over in the corner and grabbed a beer There were three or four cases of Bud stacked against the wall It was warm because there was no electricity I don t mind warm beer like some people do though It just foams a little more Beer is beer I went back out on the landing and sat down and pulled the ring tab and drank up So here we were with the whole human race wiped out not by atomic weapons or bio warfare or pollution or anything grand like that Just the flu I d like to put down a huge plaque somewhere in the Bonneville Salt Flats maybe Bronze Square Three miles on a side And in big raised letters it would say for the benefit of any landing aliens JUST THE FLU I tossed the beer can over the side It landed with a hollow clank on the cement walk that went around the building The lean-to was a dark triangle on the sand I wondered if Needles was awake I wondered if I would be Bernie She was standing in the doorway wearing one of my shirts I hate that She sweats like a Pig- You don t like me much anymore do you Bernie I didn t say anything There were times when I could still feel sorry for everything She didn t deserve me any more than I deserved her Can I sit down with you I doubt if it would be wide enough for both of us She made a choked hiccupping noise and started to go back inside Needles has got A I said She stopped and looked at me Her face was very still Don t joke Bernie I lit a cigarette He can t He had Yes he had A Hong Kong flu Just like you and me and Corey and Kelly and Joan But that would mean he isn t Immune Yes Then we could get it Maybe he lied when he said he had A So we d take him along with us that time I said Relief spilled across her face Sure that s it I would have lied if it had been me Nobody likes to be alone do they She hesitated Coming back to bed Not just now She went inside I didn t have to tell her that A was no guarantee against A She knew that She had just blocked it out I sat and watched the surf It was really up Years ago Anson had been the only halfway decent surfing spot in the state The Point was a dark jutting hump against the sky I thought I could see the upright that was the observation post but it probably was just imagination Sometimes Kelly took Joan up to the point I didn t think they were up there tonight I put my face in my hands and clutched it feeling the skin its grain and texture It was all narrowing so swiftly and it was all so mean there was no dignity in it The surf coming in coming in coming in Limitless Clean and deep We had come here in the summer Maureen and I the summer after high school the summer before college and reality and A coming out of Southeast Asia and covering the world like a pall July we had eaten pizza and listened to her radio I had put oil on her back she had put oil on mine the air had been hot the sand bright the sun like a burning glass I AM THE DOORWAY Richard and I sat on my porch looking out over the dunes to the Gulf The smoke from his cigar drifted mellowly in the air keeping the mosquitoes at a safe distance The water was a cool aqua the sky a deeper truer blue It was a pleasant combination You are the doorway Richard repeated thoughtfully You are sure you killed the boy you didn t just dream it I didn t dream it And I didn t kill him either I told you that They did I am the doorway Richard sighed You buried him Yes You remember where Yes I reached into my breast pocket and got a cigarette My hands were awkward with their covering of bandages They itched abominably If you want to see it you ll have to get the dune buggy You can t roll this I indicated my wheelchair through the sand Richard s dune buggy was a VW with pillow-sized tires He collected driftwood in it Ever since he retired from the real estate business in Maryland he had been living on Key Caroline and building driftwood sculptures which he sold to the winter tourists at shameless prices He puffed his cigar and looked out at the Gulf Not yet Will you tell me once more I sighed and tried to light my cigarette He took the matches away from me and did it himself I puffed twice dragging deep The itch in my fingers was maddening All right I said Last night at seven I was out here looking at the Gulf and smoking just like now and Go further back he invited Further Tell me about the flight I shook my head Richard we ve been through it and through it There s nothing The seamed and fissured face was as enigmatic as one of his own driftwood sculptures You may remember he said Now you may remember Do you think so Possibly And when you re through we can look for the grave The grave I said It had a hollow horrible ring darker than anything darker even than all that terrible ocean Cory and I had sailed through five years ago Dark dark dark Beneath the bandages my new eyes stared blindly into the darkness the bandages forced on them They itched Cory and I were boosted into orbit by the Saturn the one all the commentators called the Empire State Building booster It was a big beast all right It made the old Saturn B look like a Redstone and it took off from a bunker two hundred feet deep it had to to keep from taking half of Cape Kennedy with it We swung around the earth verifying all our systems and then did our inject Headed out for Venus We left a Senate fighting over an appropriations bill for further deep-space exploration and a bunch of NASA people praying that we would find something anything It don t matter what Don Lovinger Project Zeus s private whiz kid was very fond of saying when he d had a few You got all the gadgets plus five souped-up TV cameras and a nifty little telescope with a zillion lenses and filters Find some gold or platinum Better yet find some nice dumb little blue men for us to study and exploit and feel superior to Anything Even the ghost of Howdy Doody would be a start Cory and I were anxious enough to oblige if we could Nothing had worked for the deep-space program From Borman Anders and Lovell who orbited the moon in and found an empty forbidding world that looked like dirty beach sand to Markhan and Jacks who touched down on Mars eleven years later to find an arid wasteland of frozen sand and a few struggling lichens the deep-space program had been an expensive bust And there had been casualties Pedersen and Lederer eternally circling the sun when all at once nothing worked on the second-to-last Apollo flight John Davis whose little orbiting observatory was holed by a meteoroid in a one-in-a-thousand fluke No the space program was hardly swinging along The way things looked the Venus orbit might be our last chance to say we told you so It was sixteen days out we ate a lot of concentrates played a lot of gin and swapped a cold back and forth and from the tech side it was a milk run We lost an air-moisture converter on the third day out went to backup and that was all except for nits and nats until re-entry We watched Venus grow from a star to a quarter to a milky crystal ball swapped jokes with Huntsville Control listened to tapes of Wagner and the Beatles tended to automated experiments which had to do with everything from measurements of the solar wind to deep-space navigation We did two midcourse corrections both of them infinitesimal and nine days into the flight Cory went outside and banged on the retractable DES A until it decided to operate There was nothing else out of the ordinary until DESA Richard said What s that An experiment that didn t pan out NASA-ese for Deep Space Antenna we were broadcasting pi in high-frequency pulses for anyone who cared to listen I rubbed my fingers against my pants but it was no good if anything it made it worse Same idea as that radio telescope in West Virginia you know the one that listens to the stars Only instead of listening we were transmitting primarily to the deeper space planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus If there s any intelligent life out there it was taking a nap Only Cory went out Yes And if he brought in any interstellar plague the telemetry didn t show it Still It doesn t matter I said crossly Only the here and now matters They killed the boy last night Richard It wasn t a nice thing to watch or feel His head it exploded As if someone had scooped out his brains and put a hand grenade in his skull Finish the story he said I laughed hollowly What s to tell We went into an eccentric orbit around the planet It was radical and deteriorating three twenty by seventy-six miles That was on the first swing The second swing our apogee was even higher the perigee lower We had a max of four orbits We made all four We got a good look at the planet Also over six hundred stills and God knows how many feet of film The cloud cover is equal parts methane ammonia dust and flying shit The whole planet looks like the Grand Canyon in a wind tunnel Cory estimated windspeed at about mph near the surface Our probe beeped all the way down and then went out with a squawk We saw no vegetation and no sign of life Spectroscope indicated only traces of the valuable minerals And that was Venus Nothing but nothing except it scared me It was like circling a haunted house in the middle of deep space I know how unscientific that sounds but I was scared gutless until we got out of there I think if our rockets hadn t gone off I would have cut my throat on the way down It s not like the moon The moon is desolate but somehow antiseptic That world we saw was utterly unlike anything that anyone has ever seen Maybe it s a good thing that cloud cover is there It was like a skull that s been picked clean that s the closest I can get On the way back we heard the Senate had voted to halve space-exploration funds Cory said something like looks like we re back in the weather-satellite business Artie But I was almost glad Maybe we don t belong out there Twelve days later Cory was dead and I was crippled for life We bought all our trouble on the way down The chute was fouled How s that for life s little ironies We d been in space for over a month gone further than any humans had ever gone and it all ended the way it did because some guy was in a hurry for his coffee break and let a few lines get fouled We came down hard A guy that was in one of the copters said it looked like a gigantic baby falling out of the sky with the placenta trailing after it I lost consciousness when we hit I came to when they were taking me across the deck of the Portland They hadn t even had a chance to roll up the red carpet we were supposed to ve walked on I was bleeding Bleeding and being hustled up to the infirmary over a red carpet that didn t look anywhere near as red as I did I was in Bethesda for two years They gave me the Medal of Honor and a lot of money and this wheelchair I came down here the next year I like to watch the rockets take off I know Richard said He paused Show me your hands No It came out very quickly and sharply I can t let them see I ve told you that It s been five years Richard said Why now Arthur Can you tell me that I don t know I don t know Maybe whatever it is has a long gestation period Or who s to say I even got it out there Whatever it was might have entered me in Fort Lauderdale Or right here on this porch for all I know Richard sighed and looked out over the water now reddish with the late-evening sun I m trying Arthur I don t want to think that you are losing your mind If I have to I ll show you my hands I said It cost me an effort to say it But only if I have to Richard stood up and found his cane He looked old and frail I ll get the dune buggy We ll look for the boy Thank you Richard He walked out toward the rutted dirt track that led to his cabin I could just see the roof of it over the Big Dune the one that runs almost the whole length of Key Caroline Over the water toward the Cape the sky had gone an ugly plum color and the sound of thunder came faintly to my ears I didn t know the boy s name but I saw him every now and again walking along the beach at sunset with his sieve under his arm He was tanned almost black by the sun and all he was ever clad in was a frayed pair of denim cutoffs On the far side of Key Caroline there is a public beach and an enterprising young man can make perhaps as much as five dollars on a good day patiently sieving the sand for buried quarters or dimes Every now and then I would wave to him and he would wave back both of us noncommittal strangers yet brothers year-round dwellers set against a sea of money spending Cadillac- driving loud-mouthed tourists I imagine he lived in the small village clustered around the post office about a half mile further down When he passed by that evening I had already been on the porch for an hour immobile watching I had taken off the bandages earlier The itching had been intolerable and it was always better when they could look through their eyes It was a feeling like no other in the world as if I were a portal just slightly ajar through which they were peeking at a world which they hated and feared But the worst part was that I could see too in a way Imagine your mind transported into a body of a housefly a housefly looking into your own face with a thousand eyes Then perhaps you can begin to see why I kept my hands bandaged even when there was no one around to see them It began in Miami I had business there with a man named Cresswell an investigator from the Navy Department He checks up on me once a year for a while I was as close as anyone ever gets to the classified stuff our space program has I don t know just what it is he looks for a shifty gleam in the eye maybe or maybe a scarlet letter on my forehead God knows why My pension is large enough to be almost embarrassing Cresswell and I were sitting on the terrace of his hotel room sipping drinks and discussing the future of the U S space program It was about three-fifteen My fingers began to itch It wasn t a bit gradual It was switched on like electric current I mentioned it to Cresswell So you picked up some poison ivy on that scrofulous little island he said grinning The only foliage on Key Caroline is a little palmetto scrub I said Maybe it s the seven-year itch I looked down at my hands Perfectly ordinary hands But itchy Later in the afternoon I signed the same old paper I do solemnly swear that I have neither received nor disclosed and divulged information which would and drove myself back to the Key I ve got an old Ford equipped with hand-operated brake and accelerator I love it it makes me feel self-sufficient It s a long drive back down Route and by the time I got off the big road and onto the Key Caroline exit ramp I was nearly out of my mind My hands itched maddeningly If you have ever suffered through the healing of a deep cut or a surgical incision you may have some idea of the kind of itch I mean Live things seemed to be crawling and boring in my flesh The sun was almost down and I looked at my hands carefully in the glow of the dash lights The tips of them were red now red in tiny perfect circlets just above the pad where the fingerprint is where you get calluses if you play guitar There were also red circles of infection on the space between the first and second joint of each thumb and finger and on the skin between the second joint and the knuckle I pressed my right fingers to my lips and withdrew them quickly with a sudden loathing A feeling of dumb horror had risen in my throat woolen and choking The flesh where the red spots had appeared was hot feverish and the flesh was soft and gelid like the flesh of an apple gone rotten I drove the rest of the way trying to persuade myself that I had indeed caught poison ivy somehow But in the back of my mind there was another ugly thought I had an aunt back in my childhood who lived the last ten years of her life closed off from the world in an upstairs room My mother took her meals up and her name was a forbidden topic I found out later that she had Hansen s disease leprosy When I got home I called Dr Flanders on the mainland I got his answering service instead Dr Flanders was on a fishing cruise but if it was urgent Dr Ballanger When will Dr Flanders be back Tomorrow afternoon at the latest Would that Sure I hung up slowly then dialed Richard I let it ring a dozen times before hanging up After that I sat indecisive for a while The itching had deepened It seemed to emanate from the flesh itself I rolled my wheelchair over to the bookcase and pulled down the battered medical encyclopedia that I d had for years The book was maddeningly vague It could have been anything or nothing I leaned back and closed my eyes I could hear the old ship s clock ticking on the shelf across the room There was the high thin drone of a jet on its way to Miami There was the soft whisper of my own breath I was still looking at the book The realization crept on me then sank home with a frightening rush My eyes were closed but I was still looking at the book What I was seeing was smeary and monstrous the distorted fourth-dimensional counterpart of a book yet unmistakable for all that And I was not the only one watching I snapped my eyes open feeling the constriction of my heart The sensation subsided a little but not entirely I was looking at the book seeing the print and diagrams with my own eyes perfectly normal everyday experience and I was also seeing it from a different lower angle and seeing it with other eyes Seeing not a book but an alien thing something of monstrous shape and ominous intent I raised my hands slowly to my face catching an eerie vision of my living room turned into a horror house I screamed There were eyes peering up at me through splits in the flesh of my fingers And even as I watched the flesh was dilating retreating as they pushed their mindless way up to the surface But that was not what made me scream I had looked into my own face and seen a monster The dune buggy nosed over the hill and Richard brought it to a halt next to the porch The motor gunned and roared choppily I rolled my wheelchair down the inclined plane to the right of the regular steps and Richard helped me in All right Arthur he said It s your party Where to I pointed down toward the water where the Big Dune finally begins to peter out Richard nodded The rear wheels spun sand and we were off I usually found time to rib Richard about his driving but I didn t bother tonight There was too much else to think about and to feel they didn t want the dark and I could feel them straining to see through the bandages willing me to take them off The dune buggy bounced and roared through the sand toward the water seeming almost to take flight from the tops of the small dunes To the left the sun was going down in bloody glory Straight ahead and across the water the thunderclouds were beating their way toward us Lightning forked at the water Off to your right I said By that lean-to Richard brought the dune buggy to a sand-spraying halt beside the rotted remains of the lean-to reached into the back and brought out a spade I winced when I saw it Where Richard asked expressionlessly Right there I pointed to the place He got out and walked slowly through the sand to the spot hesitated for a second then plunged the shovel into the sand It seemed that he dug for a very long time The sand he was throwing back over his shoulder looked damp and moist The thunderheads were darker higher and the water looked angry and implacable under their shadow and the reflected glow of the sunset I knew long before he stopped digging that he was not going to find the boy They had moved him I hadn t bandaged my hands last night so they could see and act If they had been able to use me to kill the boy they could use me to move him even while I slept There s no boy Arthur He threw the dirty shovel into the dune buggy and sat tiredly on the seat The coming storm cast marching crescent-shaped shadows along the sand The rising breeze rattled sand against the buggy s rusted body My fingers itched They used me to move him I said dully They re getting the upper hand Richard They re forcing their doorway open a little at a time A hundred times a day I find myself standing in front of some perfectly familiar object a spatula a picture even a can of beans with no idea how I got there holding my hands out showing it to them seeing it as they do as an obscenity something twisted and grotesque Arthur he said Arthur don t Don t In the failing light his face was wan with compassion Standing in front of something you said Moving the boy s body you said But you can t walk Arthur You re dead from the waist down I touched the dashboard of the dune buggy This is dead too But when you enter it you can make it go You could make it kill It couldn t stop you even if it wanted to I could hear my voice rising hysterically I am the doorway can t you understand that They killed the boy Richard They moved the body I think you d better see a medical man he said quietly Let s go back Let s Check Check on the boy then Find out You said you didn t even know his name He must have been from the village It s a small village Ask I talked to Maud Harrington on the phone when I got the dune buggy If anyone in the state has a longer nose I ve not come across her I asked if she d heard of anyone s boy not coming home last night She said she hadn t But he s a local He has to be He reached for the ignition switch but I stopped him He turned to look at me and I began to unwrap my hands From the Gulf thunder muttered and growled I didn t go to the doctor and I didn t call Richard back I spent three weeks with my hands bandaged every time I went out Three weeks just blindly hoping it would go away It wasn t a rational act I can admit that If I had been a whole man who didn t need a wheelchair for legs or who had spent a normal life in a normal occupation I might have gone to Doc Flanders or to Richard I still might have if it hadn t been for the memory of my aunt shunned virtually a prisoner being eaten alive by her own failing flesh So I kept a desperate silence and prayed that I would wake up some morning and find it had been an evil dream And little by little I felt them Them An anonymous intelligence I never really wondered what they looked like or where they had come from It was moot I was their doorway and their window on the world I got enough feedback from them to feel their revulsion and horror to know that our world was very different from theirs Enough feedback to feel their blind hate But still they watched Their flesh was embedded in my own I began to realize that they were using me actually manipulating me When the boy passed raising one hand in his usual noncommittal salute I had just about decided to get in touch with Cresswell at his Navy Department number Richard had been right about one thing I was certain that whatever had gotten hold of me had done it in deep space or in that weird orbit around Venus The Navy would study me but they would not freakify me I wouldn t have to wake up anymore into the creaking darkness and stifle a scream as I felt them watching watching watching My hands went out toward the boy and I realized that I had not bandaged them I could see the eyes in the dying light watching silently They were large dilated golden-irised I had poked one of them against the tip of a pencil once and had felt excruciating agony slam up my arm The eye seemed to glare at me with a chained hatred that was worse than physical pain I did not poke again And now they were watching the boy I felt my mind side-slip A moment later my control was gone The door was open I lurched across the sand toward him legs scissoring nervelessly so much driven deadwood My own eyes seemed to close and I saw only with those alien eyes saw a monstrous alabaster sea-scape overtopped with a sky like a great purple way saw a leaning eroded shack that might have been the carcass of some unknown flesh-devouring creature saw an abominated creature that moved and respired and carried a device of wood and wire under its arm a device constructed of geometrically impossible right angles I wonder what he thought that wretched unnamed boy with his sieve under his arm and his pockets bulging with an odd conglomerate of sandy tourist coins what he thought when he saw me lurching at him like a blind conductor stretching out his hands over a lunatic orchestra what he thought as the last of the light fell across my hands red and split and shining with their burden of eyes what he thought when the hands made that sudden flailing gesture in the air just before his head burst I know what I thought I thought I had peeked over the rim of the universe and into the fires of hell itself The wind pulled at the bandages and made them into tiny whipping streamers as I unwrapped them The clouds had blottered the red remnants of the sunset and the dunes were dark and shadow-cast The clouds raced and boiled above us You must promise me one thing Richard I said over the rising wind You must run if it seems I might try to hurt you Do you understand that Yes His open-throated shirt whipped and rippled with the wind His face was set his own eyes little more than sockets in early dark The last of the bandages fell away I looked at Richard and they looked at Richard I saw a face I had known for five years and come to love They saw a distorted living monolith You see them I said hoarsely Now you see them He took an involuntary step backward His face became stained with a sudden unbelieving terror Lightning slashed out of the sky Thunder walked in the clouds and the water had gone black as the river Styx Arthur How hideous he was How could I have lived near him spoken with him He was not a creature but mute pestilence He was Run Run Richard And he did run He ran in huge bounding leaps He became a scaffold against the looming sky My hands flew up flew over my head in a screaming orlesque gesture the fingers reaching to the only familiar thing in this nightmare world reaching to the clouds And the clouds answered There was a huge blue-white streak of lightning that seemed like the end of the world It struck Richard it enveloped him The last thing I remember is the electric stench of ozone and burnt flesh When I awoke I was sitting calmly on my porch looking out toward the Big Dune The storm had passed and the air was pleasantly cool There was a tiny sliver of moon The sand was virginal no sign of Richard or of the dune buggy I looked down at my hands The eyes were open but glazed They had exhausted themselves They dozed I knew well enough what had to be done Before the door could be wedged open any further it had to be locked Forever Already I could notice the first signs of structural change in the hands themselves The fingers were beginning to shorten and to change There was a small hearth in the living room and in season I had been in the habit of lighting a fire against the damp Florida cold I lit one now moving with haste I had no idea when they might wake up to what I was doing When it was burning well I went out back to the kerosene drum and soaked both hands They came awake immediately screaming with agony I almost didn t make it back to the living room and to the fire But I did make it That was all seven years ago I m still here still watching the rockets take off There have been more of them lately This is a space-minded administration There has even been talk of another series of manned Venus probes I found out the boy s name not that it matters He was from the village just as I thought But his mother had expected him to stay with a friend on the mainland that night and the alarm was not raised until the following Monday Richard well everyone thought Richard was an odd duck anyway They suspect he may have gone back to Maryland or taken up with some woman As for me I m tolerated although I have quite a reputation for eccentricity myself After all how many ex-astronauts regularly write their elected Washington officials with the idea that space-exploration money could be better spent elsewhere I get along just fine with these hooks There was terrible pain for the first year or so but the human body can adjust to almost anything I shave with them and even tie my own shoe-laces And as you can see my typing is nice and even I don t expect to have any trouble putting the shotgun into my mouth or pulling the trigger It started again three weeks ago you see There is a perfect circle of twelve golden eyes on my chest THE MANGLER Officer Hunton got to the laundry just as the ambulance was leaving slowly with no siren or flashing lights Ominous Inside the office was stuffed with milling silent people some of them weeping The plant itself was empty the big automatic washers at the far end had not even been shut down It made Hunton very wary The crowd should be at the scene of the accident not in the office It was the way things worked the human animal had a built-in urge to view the remains A very bad one then Hunton felt his stomach tighten as it always did when the accident was very bad Fourteen years of cleaning human litter from highways and streets and the sidewalks at the bases of very tall buildings had not been able to erase that little hitch in the belly as if something evil had clotted there A man in a white shirt saw Hunton and walked toward him reluctantly He was a buffalo of a man with head thrust forward between shoulders nose and cheeks vein-broken either from high blood pressure or too many conversations with the brown bottle He was trying to frame words but after two tries Hunton cut him off briskly Are you the owner Mr Gartley No no I m Stanner The foreman God this Hunton got out his notebook Please show me the scene of the accident Mr Stanner and tell me what happened Stanner seemed to grow even more white the blotches on his nose and cheeks stood out like birthmarks D-do I have to Hunton raised his eyebrows I m afraid you do The call I got said it was serious Serious Stanner seemed to be battling with his gorge for a moment his Adam s apple went up and down like a monkey on a stick Mrs Frawley is dead Jesus I wish Bill Gartley was here What happened Stanner said You better come over here He led Hunton past a row of hand presses a shirt-folding unit and then stopped by a laundry-marking machine He passed a shaky hand across his forehead You ll have to go over by yourself Officer I can t look at it again It makes me I can t I m sorry Hunton walked around the marking machine with a mild feeling of contempt for the man They run a loose shop cut corners run live steam through home-welded pipes they work with dangerous cleaning chemicals without the proper protection and finally someone gets hurt Or gets dead Then they can t look They can t Hunton saw it The machine was still running No one had shut it off The machine he later came to know intimately the Hadley-Watson Model- Speed Ironer and Folder Along and clumsy name The people who worked here in the steam and the wet had a better name for it The mangier Hunton took a long frozen look and then he performed a first in his fourteen years as a law-enforcement officer he turned around put a convulsive hand to his mouth and threw up You didn t eat much Jackson said The women were inside doing dishes and talking babies while John Hunton and Mark Jackson sat in lawn chairs near the aromatic barbecue Hunton smiled slightly at the understatement He had eaten nothing There was a bad one today he said The worst Car crash No Industrial Messy Hunton did not reply immediately but his face made an involuntary writhing grimace He got a beer out of the cooler between them opened it and emptied half of it I suppose you college profs don t know anything about industrial laundries Jackson chuckled This one does I spent a summer working in one as an undergraduate Then you know the machine they call the speed ironer Jackson nodded Sure They run damp flatwork through them mostly sheets and linen A big long machine That s it Hunton said A woman named Adelle Frawley got caught in it at the Blue Ribbon Laundry crosstown It sucked her right in Jackson looked suddenly ill But that can t happen Johnny There s a safety bar If one of the women feeding the machine accidentally gets a hand under it the bar snaps up and stops the machine At least that s how I remember it Hunton nodded It s a state law But it happened Hunton closed his eyes and in the darkness he could see the Hadley-Watson speed ironer again as it had been that afternoon It formed a long rectangular box in shape thirty feet by six At the feeder end a moving canvas belt moved under the safety bar up at a slight angle and then down The belt carried the damp-dried wrinkled sheets in continuous cycle over and under sixteen huge revolving cylinders that made up the main body of the machine Over eight and under eight pressed between them like thin ham between layers of superheated bread Steam heat in the cylinders could be adjusted up to degrees for maximum drying The pressure on the sheets that rode the moving canvas belt was set at pounds per square foot to get out every wrinkle And Mrs Frawley somehow had been caught and dragged in The steel asbestos- jacketed pressing cylinders had been as red as barn paint and the rising steam from the machine had carried the sickening stench of hot blood Bits of her white blouse and blue slacks even ripped segments of her bra and panties had been torn free and ejected from the machine s far end thirty feet down the bigger sections of cloth folded with grotesque and bloodstained neatness by the automatic folder But not even that was the worst It tried to fold everything he said to Jackson tasting bile in his throat But a person isn t a sheet Mark What I saw what was left of her Like Stanner the hapless foreman he could not finish They took her out in a basket he said softly Jackson whistled Who s going to get it in the neck The laundry or the state inspectors Don t know yet Hunton said The malign image still hung behind his eyes the image of the mangier wheezing and thumping and hissing blood dripping down the green sides of the long cabinet in runnels the burning stink of her It depends on who okayed that goddamn safety bar and under what circumstances If it s the management can they wiggle out of it Hunton smiled without humor The woman died Mark If Gartley and Stanner were cutting corners on the speed ironer s maintenance they ll go to jail No matter who they know on the City Council Do you think they were cutting corners Hunton thought of the Blue Ribbon Laundry badly lighted floors wet and slippery some of the machines incredibly ancient and creaking I think it s likely he said quietly They got up to go in the house together Tell me how it comes out Johnny Jackson said I m interested Hunton was wrong about the mangier it was clean as a whistle Six state inspectors went over it before the inquest piece by piece The net result was absolutely nothing The inquest verdict was death by misadventure Hunton dumbfounded cornered Roger Martin one of the inspectors after the hearing Martin was a tall drink of water with glasses as thick as the bottoms of shot glasses He fidgeted with a bail-point pen under Hunton s questions Nothing Absolutely nothing doing with the machine Nothing Martin said Of course the safety bar was the guts of the matter It s in perfect working order You heard that Mrs Gillian testify Mrs Frawley must have pushed her hand too far No one saw that they were watching their own work She started screaming Her hand was gone already and the machine was taking her arm They tried to pull her out instead of shutting it down pure panic Another woman Mrs Keene said she did try to shut it off but it s a fair assumption that she hit the start button rather than the stop in the confusion By then it was too late Then the safety bar malfunctioned Hunton said flatly Unless she put her hand over it rather than under You can t There s a stainless-steel facing above the safety bar And the bar itself didn t malfunction It s circuited into the machine itself If the safety bar goes on the blink the machine shuts down Then how did it happen for Christ s sake We don t know My colleagues and I are of the opinion that the only way the speed ironer could have killed Mrs Frawley was for her to have fallen into it from above And she had both feet on the floor when it happened A dozen witnesses can testify to that You re describing an impossible accident Hunton said No Only one we don t understand He paused hesitated and then said I will tell you one thing Hunton since you seem to have taken this case to heart If you mention it to anyone else I ll deny I said it But I didn t like that machine It seemed almost to be mocking us I ve inspected over a dozen speed ironers in the last five years on a regular basis Some of them are in such bad shape that I wouldn t leave a dog unleashed around them the state law is lamentably lax But they were only machines for all that But this one it s a spook I don t know why but it is I think if I d found one thing even a technicality that was off whack I would have ordered it shut down Crazy huh I felt the same way Hunton said Let me tell you about something that happened two years ago in Milton the inspector said He took off his glasses and began to polish them slowly on his vest Fella had parked an old icebox out in his backyard The woman who called us said her dog had been caught in it and suffocated We got the state police-man in the area to inform him it had to go to the town dump Nice enough fella sorry about the dog He loaded it into his pickup and took it to the dump the next morning That afternoon a woman in the neighborhood reported her son missing God Hunton said The icebox was at the dump and the kid was in it dead A smart kid according to his mother She said he d no more play in an empty icebox than he would take a ride with a strange man Well he did We wrote it off Case closed I guess Hunton said No The dump caretaker went out next day to take the door off the thing City Ordinance No on the maintenance of public dumping places Martin looked at him expressionlessly He found six dead birds inside Gulls sparrows a robin And he said the door closed on his arm while he was brushing them out Gave him a hell of a jump That mangier at the Blue Ribbon strikes me like that Hunton I don t like it They looked at each other wordlessly in the empty inquest chamber some six city blocks from where the Hadley-Watson Model- Speed Ironer and Folder sat in the busy laundry steaming and fuming over its sheets The case was driven out of his mind in the space of a week by the press of more prosaic police work It was only brought back when he and his wife dropped over to Mark Jackson s house for an evening of bid whist and beer Jackson greeted him with Have you ever wondered if that laundry machine you told me about is haunted Johnny Hunton blinked at a loss What The speed ironer at the Blue Ribbon Laundry I guess you didn t catch the squeal this time What squeal Hunton asked interested Jackson passed him the evening paper and pointed to an item at the bottom of page two The story said that a steam line had let go on the large speed ironer at the Blue Ribbon Laundry burning three of the six women working at the feeder end The accident had occurred at p m and was attributed to a rise in steam pressure from the laundry s boiler One of the women Mrs Annette Gillian had been held at City Receiving Hospital with second-degree burns Funny coincidence he said but the memory of Inspector Martin s words in the empty inquest chamber suddenly recurred It s a spook And the story about the dog and the boy and the birds caught in the discarded refrigerator He played cards very badly that night Mrs Gillian was propped up in bed reading Screen Secrets when Hunton came into the four-bed hospital room A large bandage blanketed one arm and the side of her neck The room s other occupant a young woman with a pallid face was sleeping Mrs Gillian blinked at the blue uniform and then smiled tentatively If it was for Mrs Cherinikov you ll have to come back later They just gave her medication No it s for you Mrs Gillian Her smile faded a little I m here unofficially which means I m curious about the accident at the laundry John Hunton He held out his hand It was the right move Mrs Gillian s smile became brilliant and she took his grip awkwardly with her unburnt hand Anything I can tell you Mr Hunton God I thought my Andy was in trouble at school again What happened We was running sheets and the ironer just blew up or it seemed that way I was thinking about going home an getting off my dogs when there s this great big bang like a bomb Steam is everywhere and this hissing noise awful Her smile trembled on the verge of extinction It was like the ironer was breathing Like a dragon it was And Alberta that s Alberta Keene shouted that something was exploding and everyone was running and screaming and Ginny Jason started yelling she was burnt I started to run away and I fell down I didn t know I got it worst until then God forbid it was no worse than it was That live steam is three hundred degrees The paper said a steam line let go What does that mean The overhead pipe comes down into this kinda flexible line that feeds the machine George Mr Stanner said there must have been a surge from the boiler or something The line split wide open Hunton could think of nothing else to ask He was making ready to leave when she said reflectively We never used to have these things on that machine Only lately The steam line breaking That awful awful accident with Mrs Frawley God rest her And little things Like the day Essie got her dress caught in one of the drive chains That could have been dangerous if she hadn t ripped it right out Bolts and things fall off Oh Herb Diment he s the laundry repairman has had an awful time with it Sheets get caught in the folder George says that s because they re using too much bleach in the washers but it never used to happen Now the girls hate to work on it Essie even says there are still little bits of Adelle Frawley caught in it and it s sacrilege or something Like it had a curse It s been that way ever since Sherry cut her hand on one of the clamps Sherry Hunton asked Sherry Ouelette Pretty little thing just out of high school Good worker But clumsy sometimes You know how young girls are She cut her hand on something Nothing strange about that There are clamps to tighten down the feeder belt see Sherry was adjusting them so we could do a heavier load and probably dreaming about some boy She cut her finger and bled all over everything Mrs Gillian looked puzzled It wasn t until after that the bolts started falling off Adelle was you know about a week later As if the machine had tasted blood and found it liked it Don t women get funny ideas sometimes Officer Hinton Hunton he said absently looking over her head and into space Ironically he had met Mark Jackson in a washateria in the block that separated their houses and it was there that the cop and the English professor still had their most interesting conversations Now they sat side by side in bland plastic chairs their clothes going round and round behind the glass portholes of the coin-op washers Jackson s paperback copy of Milton s collected works lay neglected beside him while he listened to Hunton tell Mrs Gillian s story When Hunton had finished Jackson said I asked you once if you thought the mangier might be haunted I was only half joking I ll ask you again now No Hunton said uneasily Don t be stupid Jackson watched the turning clothes reflectively Haunted is a bad word Let s say possessed There are almost as many spells for casting demons in as there are for casting them out Frazier s Golden Bough is replete with them Druidic and Aztec lore contain others Even older ones back to Egypt Almost all of them can be reduced to startlingly common denominators The most common of course is the blood of a virgin He looked at Hunton Mrs Gillian said the trouble started after this Sherry Ouelette accidentally cut herself Oh come on Hunton said You have to admit she sounds just the type Jackson said I ll run right over to her house Hunton said with a small smile I can see it Miss Ouelette I m Officer John Hunton I m investigating an ironer with a bad case of demon possession and would like to know if you re a virgin Do you think I d get a chance to say goodbye to Sandra and the kids before they carted me off to the booby hatch I d be willing to bet you ll end up saying something just like that Jackson said without smiling I m serious Johnny That machine scares the hell out of me and I ve never seen it For the sake of conversation Hunton said what are some of the other so-called common denominators Jackson shrugged Hard to say without study Most Anglo-Saxon hex formulas specify graveyard dirt or the eye of a toad European spells often mention the hand of glory which can be interpreted as the actual hand of a dead man or one of the hallucinogenics used in connection with the Witches Sabbath usually belladonna or a psilocybin derivative There could be others And you think all those things got into the Blue Ribbon ironer Christ Mark I ll bet there isn t any belladonna within a five-hundred-mile radius Or do you think someone whacked off their Uncle Fred s hand and dropped it in the folder If seven hundred monkeys typed for seven hundred years One of them would turn out the works of Shakespeare Hunton finished sourly Go to hell Your turn to go across to the drugstore and get some dimes for the dryers It was very funny how George Stanner lost his arm in the mangier Seven o clock Monday morning the laundry was deserted except for Stanner and Herb Diment the maintenance man They were performing the twice-yearly function of greasing the mangier s bearings before the laundry s regular day began at seven-thirty Diment was at the far end greasing the four secondaries and thinking of how unpleasant this machine made him feel lately when the mangier suddenly roared into life He had been holding up four of the canvas exit belts to get at the motor beneath and suddenly the belts were running in his hands ripping the flesh off his palms dragging him along He pulled free with a convulsive jerk seconds before the belts would have carried his hands into the folder What the Christ George he yelled Shut the frigging thing off George Stanner began to scream It was a high wailing blood-maddened sound that filled the laundry echoing off the steel faces of the washers the grinning mouths of the steam presses the vacant eyes of the industrial dryers Stanner drew in a great whooping gasp of air and screamed again Oh God of Christ I m caught I M CAUGHT The rollers began to produce rising steam The folder gnashed and thumped Bearings and motors seemed to cry out with a hidden life of their own Diment raced to the other end of the machine The first roller was already going a sinister red Diment made a moaning gobbling noise in his throat The mangier howled and thumped and hissed A deaf observer might have thought at first that Stanner was merely bent over the machine at an odd angle Then even a deaf man would have seen the pallid eye-bulging rictus of his face mouth twisted open in a continuous scream The arm was disappearing under the safety bar and beneath the first roller the fabric of his shirt had torn away at the shoulder seam and his upper arm bulged grotesquely as the blood was pushed steadily backward Turn it off Stanner screamed There was a snap as his elbow broke Diment thumbed the off button The mangier continued to hum and growl and turn Unbelieving he slammed the button again and again nothing The skin of Stanner s arm had grown shiny and taut Soon it would split with the pressure the roll was putting on it and still he was conscious and screaming Diment had a nightmare cartoon image of a man flattened by a steamroller leaving only a shadow Fuses Stanner screeched His head was being pulled down down as he was dragged forward Diment whirled and ran to the boiler room Stanner s screams chasing him like lunatic ghosts The mixed stench of blood and steam rose in the air On the left wall were three heavy gray boxes containing all the fuses for the laundry s electricity Diment yanked them open and began to pull the long cylindrical fuses like a crazy man throwing them back over his shoulders The overhead lights went out then the air compressor then the boiler itself with a huge dying whine And still the mangier turned Stanner s screams had been reduced to bubbly moans Diment s eye happened on the fire ax in its glassed-in box He grabbed it with a small gagging whimper and ran back Stanner s arm was gone almost to the shoulder Within seconds his bent and straining neck would be snapped against the safety bar I can t Diment blubbered holding the ax Jesus George I can t I can t I The machine was an abattoir now The folder spat out pieces of shirt sleeve scraps of flesh a finger Stanner gave a huge whooping scream and Diment swung the ax up and brought it down in the laundry s shadowy lightlessness Twice Again Stanner fell away unconscious and blue blood jetting from the stump just below the shoulder The mangier sucked what was left into itself and shut down Weeping Diment pulled his belt out of its loops and began to make a tourniquet Hunton was talking on the phone with Roger Martin the inspector Jackson watched him while he patiently rolled a ball back and forth for three-year-old Patty Hunton to chase He pulled all the fuses Hunton was asking And the off button just didn t function huh Has the ironer been shut down Good Great Huh No not official Hunton frowned then looked sideways at Jackson Are you still reminded of that refrigerator Roger Yes Me too Goodbye He hung up and looked at Jackson Let s go see the girl Mark She had her own apartment the hesitant yet proprietary way she showed them in after Hunton had flashed his buzzer made him suspect that she hadn t had it long and she sat uncomfortably across from them in the carefully decorated postage-stamp living room I m Officer Hunton and this is my associate Mr Jackson It s about the accident at the laundry He felt hugely uncomfortable with this dark shyly pretty girl Awful Sherry Ouelette murmured It s the only place I ve ever worked Mr Gartley is my uncle I liked it because it let me have this place and my own friends But now it s so spooky The State Board of Safety has shut the ironer down pending a full investigation Hunton said Did you know that Sure She sighed restlessly I don t know what I m going to do Miss Ouelette Jackson interrupted you had an accident with the ironer didn t you Cut your hand on a clamp I believe Yes I cut my finger Suddenly her face clouded That was the first thing She looked at them woefully Sometimes I feel like the girls don t like me so much anymore as if I were to blame I have to ask you a hard question Jackson said slowly A question you won t like It seems absurdly personal and off the subject but I can only tell you it is not Your answers won t ever be marked down in a file or record She looked frightened D-did I do something Jackson smiled and shook his head she melted Thank God for Mark Hunton thought I ll add this though the answer may help you keep your nice little flat here get your job back and make things at the laundry the way they were before I d answer anything to have that she said Sherry are you a virgin She looked utterly flabbergasted utterly shocked as if a priest had given communion and then slapped her Then she lifted her head made a gesture at her neat efficiency apartment as if asking them how they could believe it might be a place of assignation I m saving myself for my husband she said simply Hunton and Jackson looked calmly at each other and in that tick of a second Hunton knew that it was all true a devil had taken over the inanimate steel and cogs and gears of the mangier and had turned it into something with its own life Thank you Jackson said quietly What now Hunton asked bleakly as they rode back Find a priest to exorcise it Jackson snorted You d go a far piece to find one that wouldn t hand you a few tracts to read while he phoned the booby hatch It has to be our play Johnny Can we do it Maybe The problem is this We know something is in the mangier We don t know what Hunton felt cold as if touched by a fleshless finger There are a great many demons Is the one we re dealing with in the circle of Bubastis or Pan Baal Or the Christian deity we call Satan We don t know If the demon had been deliberately cast we would have a better chance But this seems to be a case of random possession Jackson ran his fingers through his hair The blood of a virgin yes But that narrows it down hardly at all We have to be sure very sure Why Hunton asked bluntly Why not just get a bunch of exorcism formulas together and try them out Jackson s face went cold This isn t cops n robbers Johnny For Christ s sake don t think it is The rite of exorcism is horribly dangerous It s like controlled nuclear fission in a way We could make a mistake and destroy ourselves The demon is caught in that piece of machinery But give it a chance and It could get out It would love to get out Jackson said grimly And it likes to kill When Jackson came over the following evening Hunton had sent his wife and daughter to a movie They had the living room to themselves and for this Hunton was relieved He could still barely believe what he had become involved in I canceled my classes Jackson said and spent the day with some of the most god awful books you can imagine This afternoon I fed over thirty recipes for calling demons into the tech computer I ve got a number of common elements Surprisingly few He showed Hunton the list blood of a virgin graveyard dirt hand of glory bat s blood night moss horse s hoof eye of toad There were others all marked secondary Horse s hoof Hunton said thoughtfully Funny Very common In fact Could these things any of them be interpreted loosely Hunton interrupted If lichens picked at night could be substituted for night moss for instance Yes It s very likely Jackson said Magical formulas are often ambiguous and elastic The black arts have always allowed plenty of room for creativity Substitute Jell- for horse s hoof Hunton said Very popular in bag lunches I noticed a little container of it sitting under the ironer s sheet platform on the day the Frawley woman died Gelatin is made from horses hooves Jackson nodded Anything else Bat s blood well it s a big place Lots of unlighted nooks and crannies Bats seem likely although I doubt if the management would admit to it One could conceivably have been trapped in the mangier Jackson tipped his head back and knuckled bloodshot eyes It fits it all fits It does Yes We can safely rule out the hand of glory I think Certainly no one dropped a hand into the ironer before Mrs Frawley s death and belladonna is definitely not indigenous to the area Graveyard dirt What do you think It would have to be a hell of a coincidence Hunton said Nearest cemetery is Pleasant Hill and that s five miles from the Blue Ribbon Okay Jackson said I got the computer operator who thought I was getting ready for Halloween to run a positive breakdown of all the primary and secondary elements on the list Every possible combination I threw out some two dozen which were completely meaningless The others fall into fairly clear-cut categories The elements we ve isolated are in one of those What is it Jackson grinned An easy one The mythos centers in South America with branches in the Caribbean Related to voodoo The literature I ve got looks on the deities as strictly bush league compared to some of the real heavies like Saddath or He-Who-Cannot-Be- Named The thing in that machine is going to slink away like the neighborhood bully How do we do it Holy water and a smidgen of the Holy Eucharist ought to do it And we can read some of the Leviticus to it Strictly Christian white magic You re sure it s not worse Don t see how it can be Jackson said pensively I don t mind telling you I was worried about that hand of glory That s very black juju Strong magic Holy water wouldn t stop it A demon called up in conjunction with the hand of glory could eat a stack of Bibles for breakfast We would be in bad trouble messing with something like that at all Better to pull the goddamn thing apart Well are you completely sure No but fairly sure It all fits too well When The sooner the better Jackson said How do we get in Break a window Hunton smiled reached into his pocket and dangled a key in front of Jackson s nose Where d you get that Gartley No Hunton said From a state inspector named Martin He know what we re doing I think he suspects He told me a funny story a couple of weeks ago About the mangier No Hunton said About a refrigerator Come on Adelle Frawley was dead sewed together by a patient undertaker she lay in her coffin Yet something of her spirit perhaps remained in the machine and if it did it cried out She would have known could have warned them She had been prone to indigestion and for this common ailment she had taken a common stomach tablet called E-Z Gel purchasable over the counter of any drugstore for seventy-nine cents The side panel holds a printed warning People with glaucoma must not take E-Z Gel because the active ingredient causes an aggravation of that condition Unfortunately Adelle Frawley did not have that condition She might have remembered the day shortly before Sherry Ouelette cut her hand that she had dropped a full box of E-Z Gel tablets into the mangier by accident But she was dead unaware that the active ingredient which soothed her heartburn was a chemical derivative of belladonna known quaintly in some European countries as the hand of glory There was a sudden ghastly burping noise in the spectral silence of the Blue Ribbon Laundry a bat fluttered madly for its hole in the insulation above the dryers where it had roosted wrapping wings around its blind face It was a noise almost like a chuckle The mangier began to run with a sudden lurching grind belts hurrying through the darkness cogs meeting and meshing and grinding heavy pulverizing rollers rotating on and on It was ready for them When Hunton pulled into the parking lot it was shortly after midnight and the moon was hidden behind a raft of moving clouds He jammed on the brakes and switched off the lights in the same motion Jackson s forehead almost slammed against the padded dash He switched off the ignition and the steady thump-hiss-thump became louder It s the mangier he said slowly It s the mangier Running by itself In the middle of the night They sat for a moment in silence feeling the fear crawl up their legs Hunton said All right Let s do it They got out and walked to the building the sound of the mangier growing louder As Hunton put the key into the lock of the service door he thought that the machine did sound alive as if it were breathing in great hot gasps and speaking to itself in hissing sardonic whispers All of a sudden I m glad I m with a cop Jackson said He shifted the brown bag he held from one arm to the other Inside was a small jelly jar filled with holy water wrapped in waxed paper and a Gideon Bible They stepped inside and Hunton snapped up the light switches by the door The fluorescents flickered into cold life At the same instant the mangier shut off A membrane of steam hung over its rollers It waited for them in its new ominous silence God it s an ugly thing Jackson whispered Come on Hunton said Before we lose our nerve They walked over to it The safety bar was in its down position over the belt which fed the machine Hunton put out a hand Close enough Mark Give me the stuff and tell me what to do But No argument Jackson handed him the bag and Hunton put it on the sheet table in front of the machine He gave Jackson the Bible I m going to read Jackson said When I point at you sprinkle the holy water on the machine with your fingers You say In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost get thee from this place thou unclean Got it Yes The second time I point break the wafer and repeat the incantation again How will we know if it s working You ll know The thing is apt to break every window in the place getting out If it doesn t work the first time we keep doing it until it does I m scared green Hunton said As a matter of fact so am I If we re wrong about the hand of glory We re not Jackson said Here we go He began His voice filled the empty laundry with spectral echoes Turnest not thou aside to idols nor make molten gods for yourself I am the Lord thy God The words fell like stones into a silence that had suddenly become filled with a creeping tomblike cold The mangier remained still and silent under the fluorescents and to Hunton it still seemed to grin and the land will vomit you out for having defiled it as it vomited out nations before you Jackson looked up his face strained and pointed Hunton sprinkled holy water across the feeder belt There was a sudden gnashing scream of tortured metal Smoke rose from the canvas belts where the holy water had touched and took on writhing red-tinged shapes The mangier suddenly jerked into life We ve got it Jackson cried above the rising clamor It s on the run He began to read again his voice rising over the sound of the machinery He pointed to Hunton again and Hunton sprinkled some of the host As he did so he was suddenly swept with a bone-freezing terror a sudden vivid feeling that it had gone wrong that the machine had called their bluff and was the stronger Jackson s voice was still rising approaching climax Sparks began to jump across the arc between the main motor and the secondary the smell of ozone filled the air like the copper smell of hot blood Now the main motor was smoking the mangier was running at an insane blurred speed a finger touched to the central belt would have caused the whole body to be hauled in and turned to a bloody rag in the space of five seconds The concrete beneath their feet trembled and thrummed A main bearing blew with a searing flash of purple light filling the chill air with the smell of thunderstorms and still the mangier ran faster and faster belts and rollers and cogs moving at a speed that made them seem to blend and merge change melt transmute Hunton who had been standing almost hypnotized suddenly took a step backward Get away he screamed over the blaring racket We ve almost got it Jackson yelled back Why There was a sudden indescribable ripping noise and a fissure in the concrete floor suddenly raced toward them and past widening Chips of ancient cement flew up in a starburst Jackson looked at the mangier and screamed It was trying to pull itself out of the concrete like a dinosaur trying to escape a tar pit And it wasn t precisely an ironer anymore It was still changing melting The volt cable fell spitting blue fire into the rollers and was chewed away For a moment two fireballs glared at them like lambent eyes eyes filled with a great and cold hunger Another fault line tore open The mangier leaned toward them within an ace of being free of the concrete moorings that held it It leered at them the safety bar had slammed up and what Hunton saw was a gaping hungry mouth filled with steam They turned to run and another fissure opened at their feet Behind them a great screaming roar as the thing came free Hunton leaped over but Jackson stumbled and fell sprawling Hunton turned to help and a huge amorphous shadow fell over him blocking the fluore scents It stood over Jackson who lay on his back staring up in a silent rictus of terror the perfect sacrifice Hunton had only a confused impression of something black and moving that bulked to a tremendous height above them both something with glaring electric eyes the size of footballs an open mouth with a moving canvas tongue He ran Jackson s dying scream followed him When Roger Martin finally got out of bed to answer the doorbell he was still only a third awake but when Hunton reeled in shock slapped him fully into the world with a rough hand Hunton s eyes bulged madly from his head and his hands were claws as he scratched at the front of Martin s robe There was a small oozing cut on his cheek and his face was splashed with dirty gray specks of powdered cement His hair had gone dead white Help me for Jesus sake help me Mark is dead Jackson is dead Slow down Martin said Come in the living room Hunton followed him making a thick whining noise in his throat like a dog Martin poured him a two-ounce knock of Jim Beam and Hunton held the glass in both hands downing the raw liquor in a choked gulp The glass fell unheeded to the carpet and his hands like wandering ghosts sought Martin s lapels again The mangier killed Mark Jackson It it oh God it might get out We can t let it get out We can t we oh He began to scream a crazy whooping sound that rose and fell in jagged cycles Martin tried to hand him another drink but Hunton knocked it aside We have to burn it he said Burn it before it can get out Oh what if it gets out Oh Jesus what if His eyes suddenly flickered glazed rolled up to show the whites and he fell to the carpet in a stonelike faint Mrs Martin was in the doorway clutching her robe to her throat Who is he Rog Is he crazy I thought She shuddered I don t think he s crazy She was suddenly frightened by the sick shadow of fear on her husband s face God I hope he came quick enough He turned to the telephone picked up the receiver froze There was a faint swelling noise from the east of the house the way that Hunton had come A steady grinding clatter growing louder The living-room window stood half open and now Martin caught a dark smell on the breeze An odor of ozone or blood He stood with his hand on the useless telephone as it grew louder louder gnashing and fuming something in the streets that was hot and steaming The blood stench filled the room His hand dropped from the telephone It was already out THE BOOGEYMAN I came to you because I want to tell my story the man on Dr Harper s couch was saying The man was Lester Billings from Waterbury Connecticut According to the history taken from Nurse Vickers he was twenty-eight employed by an industrial firm in New York divorced and the father of three children All deceased I can t go to a priest because I m not Catholic I can t go to a lawyer because I haven t done anything to consult a lawyer about All I did was kill my kids One at a time Killed them all Dr Harper turned on the tape recorder Billings lay straight as a yardstick on the couch not giving it an inch of himself His feet protruded stiffly over the end Picture of a man enduring necessary humiliation His hands were folded corpselike on his chest His face was carefully set He looked at the plain white composition ceiling as if seeing scenes and pictures played out there Do you mean you actually killed them or No Impatient flick of the hand But I was responsible Denny in Shirl in And Andy this year I want to tell you about it Dr Harper said nothing He thought that Billings looked haggard and old His hair was thinning his complexion sallow His eyes held all the miserable secrets of whiskey They were murdered see Only no one believes that If they would things would be all right Why is that Because Billings broke off and darted up on his elbows staring across the room What s that he barked His eyes had narrowed to black slots What s what That door The closet Dr Harper said Where I hang my coat and leave my overshoes Open it I want to see Dr Harper got up wordlessly crossed the room and opened the closet Inside a tan raincoat hung on one of four or five hangers Beneath that was a pair of shiny galoshes The New York Times had been carefully tucked into one of them That was all All right Dr Harper said All right Billings removed the props of his elbows and returned to his previous position You were saying Dr Harper said as he went back to his chair that if the murder of your three children could be proved all your troubles would be over Why is that I d go to jail Billings said immediately For life And you can see into all the rooms in a jail All the rooms He smiled at nothing How were your children murdered Don t try to jerk it out of me Billings twitched around and stared balefully at Harper I ll tell you don t worry I m not one of your freaks strutting around and pretending to be Napoleon or explaining that I got hooked on heroin because my mother didn t love me I know you won t believe me I don t care It doesn t matter Just to tell will be enough All right Dr Harper got out his pipe I married Rita in I was twenty-one and she was eighteen She was pregnant That was Denny His lips twisted in a rubbery frightening grin that was gone in a wink I had to leave college and get a job but I didn t mind I loved both of them We were very happy Rita got pregnant just a little while after Denny was born and Shirl came along in December of Andy came in the summer of and Denny was already dead by then Andy was an accident That s what Rita said She said sometimes that birth-control stuff doesn t work I think that it was more than an accident Children tie a man down you know Women like that especially when the man is brighter than they Don t you find that s true Harper grunted noncommittally It doesn t matter though I loved him anyway He said it almost vengefully as if he had loved the child to spite his wife Who killed the children Harper asked The boogeyman Lester Billings answered immediately The boogeyman killed them all Just came out of the closet and killed them He twisted around and grinned You think I m crazy all right It s written all over you But I don t care All I want to do is tell you and then get lost I m listening Harper said It started when Denny was almost two and Shirl was just an infant He started crying when Rita put him to bed We had a two-bedroom place see Shirl slept in a crib in our room At first I thought he was crying because he didn t have a bottle to take to bed anymore Rita said don t make an issue of it let it go let him have it and he ll drop it on his own But that s the way kids start off bad You get permissive with them spoil them Then they break your heart Get some girl knocked up you know or start shooting dope Or they get to be sissies Can you imagine waking up some morning and finding your kid your son is a sissy After a while though when he didn t stop I started putting him to bed myself And if he didn t stop crying I d give him a whack Then Rita said he was saying light over and over again Well I didn t know Kids that little how can you tell what they re saying Only a mother can tell Rita wanted to put in a nightlight One of those wall-plug things with Mickey Mouse or Huckleberry Hound or something on it I wouldn t let her If a kid doesn t get over being afraid of the dark when he s little he never gets over it Anyway he died the summer after Shirl was born I put him to bed that night and he started to cry right off I heard what he said that time He pointed right at the closet when he said it Boogeyman the kid says Boogeyman Daddy I turned off the light and went into our room and asked Rita why she wanted to teach the kid a word like that I was tempted to slap her around a little but I didn t She said she never taught him to say that I called her a goddamn liar That was a bad summer for me see The only job I could get was loading Pepsi-Cola trucks in a warehouse and I was tired all the time Shirl would wake up and cry every night and Rita would pick her up and sniffle I tell you sometimes I felt like throwing them both out a window Christ kids drive you crazy sometimes You could kill them Well the kid woke me at three in the morning right on schedule I went to the bathroom only a quarter awake you know and Rita asked me if I d check on Denny I told her to do it herself and went back to bed I was almost asleep when she started to scream I got up and went in The kid was dead on his back Just as white as flour except for where the blood had had sunk Back of the legs the head the a the buttocks His eyes were open That was the worst you know Wide open and glassy like the eyes you see on a moosehead some guy put over his mantel Like pictures you see of those gook kids over in Nam But an American kid shouldn t look like that Dead on his back Wearing diapers and mbber pants because he d been wetting himself again the last couple of weeks Awful I loved that kid Billings shook his head slowly then offered the rubbery frightening grin again Rita was screaming her head off She tried to pick Denny up and rock him but I wouldn t let her The cops don t like you to touch any of the evidence I know that Did you know it was the boogeyman then Harper asked quietly Oh no Not then But I did see one thing It didn t mean anything to me then but my mind stored it away What was that The closet door was open Not much Just a crack But I knew I left it shut see There s dry-cleaning bags in there A kid messes around with one of those and bango Asphyxiation You know that Yes What happened then Billings shrugged We planted him He looked morbidly at his hands which had thrown dirt on three tiny coffins Was there an inquest Sure Billings eyes flashed with sardonic brilliance Some back-country fuckhead with a stethoscope and a black bag full of Junior Mints and a sheepskin from some cow college Crib death he called it You ever hear such a pile of yellow manure The kid was three years old Crib death is most common during the first year Harper said carefully but that diagnosis has gone on death certificates for children up to age five for want of a better Bullshit Billings spat out violently Harper relit his pipe We moved Shirl into Denny s old room a month after the funeral Rita fought it tooth and nail but I had the last word It hurt me of course it did Jesus I loved having the kid in with us But you can t get overprotective You make a kid a cripple that way When I was a kid my mom used to take me to the beach and then scream herself hoarse Don t go out so far Don t go there It s got an undertow You only ate an hour ago Don t go over your head Even to watch out for sharks before God So what happens I can t even go near the water now It s the truth I get the cramps if I go near a beach Rita got me to take her and the kids to Savin Rock once when Denny was alive I got sick as a dog I know see You can t overprotect kids And you can t coddle yourself either Life goes on Shirl went right into Denny s crib We sent the old mattress to the dump though I didn t want my girl to get any germs So a year goes by And one night when I m putting Shirl into her crib she starts to yowl and scream and cry Boogeyman Daddy boogeyman boogeyman That threw a jump into me It was just like Denny And I started to remember about that closet door open just a crack when we found him I wanted to take her into our room for the night Did you No Billings regarded his hands and his face twitched How could I go to Rita and admit I was wrong I had to be strong She was always such a jellyfish look how easy she went to bed with me when we weren t married Harper said On the other hand look how easily you went to bed with her Billings froze in the act of rearranging his hands and slowly turned his head to look at Harper Are you trying to be a wise guy No indeed Harper said Then let me tell it my way Billings snapped I came here to get this off my chest To tell my story I m not going to talk about my sex life if that s what you expect Rita and I had a very normal sex life with none of that dirty stuff I know it gives some people a charge to talk about that but I m not one of them Okay Harper said Okay Billings echoed with uneasy arrogance He seemed to have lost the thread of his thought and his eyes wandered uneasily to the closet door which was firmly shut Would you like that open Harper asked No Billings said quickly He gave a nervous little laugh What do I want to look at your overshoes for The boogeyman got her too Billings said He bmshed at his forehead as if sketching memories A month later But something happened before that I heard a noise in there one night And then she screamed I opened the door real quick the hall light was on and she was sitting up in the crib crying and something moved Back in the shadows by the closet Something slithered Was the closet door open A little Just a crack Billings licked his lips Shirl was screaming about the boogeyman And something else that sounded like claws Only she said craws you know Little kids have trouble with that T sound Rita ran upstairs and asked what the matter was I said she got scared by the shadows of the branches moving on the ceiling Crawset Harper said Huh Crawset closet Maybe she was trying to say closet Maybe Billings said Maybe that was it But I don t think so I think it was claws His eyes began seeking the closet door again Claws long claws His voice had sunk to a whisper Did you look in the closet Y-yes Billings hands were laced tightly across his chest laced tightly enough to show a white moon at each knuckle Was there anything in there Did you see the J didn t see anything Billings screamed suddenly And the words poured out as if a black cork had been pulled from the bottom of his soul When she died I found her see And she was black All black She swallowed her own tongue and she was just as black as a nigger in a minstrel show and she was staring at me Her eyes they looked like those eyes you see on stuffed animals all shiny and awful like live marbles and they were saying it got me Daddy you let it get me you killed me you helped it kill me His words trailed off One single tear very large and silent ran down the side of his cheek It was a brain convulsion see Kids get those sometimes A bad signal from the brain They had an autopsy at Hartford Receiving and they told us she choked on her tongue from the convulsion And I had to go home alone because they kept Rita under sedation She was out of her mind I had to go back to that house all alone and I know a kid don t just get convulsions because their brain frigged up You can scare a kid into convulsions And I had to go back to the house where it was He whispered I slept on the couch With the light on Did anything happen I had a dream Billings said I was in a dark room and there was something I couldn t couldn t quite see in the closet It made a noise a squishy noise It reminded me of a comic book I read when I was a kid Tales from the Crypt you remember that Christ They had a guy named Graham Ingles he could draw every god awful thing in the world and some out of it Anyway in this story this woman drowned her husband see Put cement blocks on his feet and dropped him into a quarry Only he came back He was all rotted and black-green and the fish had eaten away one of his eyes and there was seaweed in his hair He came back and killed her And when I woke up in the middle of the night I thought that would be leaning over me With claws long claws Dr Harper looked at the digital clock inset into his desk Lester Billings had been speaking for nearly half an hour He said When your wife came back home what was her attitude toward you She still loved me Billings said with pride She still wanted to do what I told her That s the wife s place right This women s lib only makes sick people The most important thing in life is for a person to know his place His his uh Station in life That s it Billings snapped his fingers That s it exactly And a wife should follow her husband Oh she was sort of colorless the first four or five months after dragged around the house didn t sing didn t watch the TV didn t laugh I knew she d get over it When they re that little you don t get so attached to them After a while you have to go to the bureau drawer and look at a picture to even remember exactly what they looked like She wanted another baby he added darkly I told her it was a bad idea Oh not forever but for a while I told her it was a time for us to get over things and begin to enjoy each other We never had a chance to do that before If you wanted to go to a movie you had to hassle around for a baby-sitter You couldn t go into town to see the Mets unless her folks would take the kids because my mom wouldn t have anything to do with us Denny was born too soon after we were married see She said Rita was just a tramp a common little corner-walker Corner-walker is what my mom always called them Isn t that a sketch She sat me down once and told me diseases you can get if you went to a cor to a prostitute How your pri your penis has just a little tiny sore on it one day and the next day it s rotting right off She wouldn t even come to the wedding Billings drummed his chest with his fingers Rita s gynecologist sold her on this thing called an IUD interuterine device Foolproof the doctor said He just sticks it up the woman s her place and that s it If there s anything in there the egg can t fertilize You don t even know it s there He smiled at the ceiling with dark sweetness No one knows if it s there or not And next year she s pregnant again Some foolproof No birth-control method is perfect Harper said The pill is only ninety-eight percent The IUD may be ejected by cramps strong menstrual flow and in exceptional cases by evacuation Yeah Or you can take it out That s possible So what s next She s knitting little things singing in the shower and eating pickles like crazy Sitting on my lap and saying things about how it must have been God s will Piss The baby came at the end of the year after Shirl s death That s right A boy She named it Andrew Lester Billings I didn t want anything to do with it at least at first My motto was she screwed up so let her take care of it I know how that sounds but you have to remember that I d been through a lot But I warmed up to him you know it He was the only one of the litter that looked like me for one thing Denny looked like his mother and Shirl didn t look like anybody except maybe my Grammy Ann But Andy was the spitting image of me I d get to playing around with him in his playpen when I got home from work He d grab only my finger and smile and gurgle Nine weeks old and the kid was grinning up at his old dad You believe that Then one night here I am coming out of a drugstore with a mobile to hang over the kid s crib Me Kids don t appreciate presents until they re old enough to say thank you that was always my motto But there I was buying him silly crap and all at once I realize I love him the most of all I had another job by then a pretty good one selling drill bits for Cluett and Sons I did real well and when Andy was one we moved to Waterbury The old place had too many bad memories And too many closets That next year was the best one for us I d give every finger on my right hand to have it back again Oh the war in Vietnam was still going on and the hippies were still running around with no clothes on and the niggers were yelling a lot but none of that touched us We were on a quiet street with nice neighbors We were happy he summed up simply I asked Rita once if she wasn t worried You know bad luck comes in threes and all that She said not for us She said Andy was special She said God had drawn a ring around him Billings looked morbidly at the ceiling Last year wasn t so good Something about the house changed I started keeping my boots in the hall because I didn t like to open the closet door anymore I kept thinking Well what if it s in there All crouched down and ready to spring the second I open the door And I d started thinking I could hear squishy noises as if something black and green and wet was moving around in there just a little Rita asked me if I was working too hard and I started to snap at her just like the old days I got sick to my stomach leaving them alone to go to work but I was glad to get out God help me I was glad to get out I started to think see that it lost us for a while when we moved It had to hunt around slinking through the streets at night and maybe creeping in the sewers Smelling for us It took a year but it found us It s back It wants Andy and it wants me I started to think maybe if you think of a thing long enough and believe in it it gets real Maybe all the monsters we were scared of when we were kids Frankenstein and Wolfman and Mummy maybe they were real Real enough to kill the kids that were supposed to have fallen into gravel pits or drowned in lakes or were just never found Maybe Are you backing away from something Mr Billings Billings was silent for a long time two minutes clicked off the digital clock Then he said abruptly Andy died in February Rita wasn t there She got a call from her father Her mother had been in a car crash the day after New Year s and wasn t expected to live She took a bus back that night Her mother didn t die but she was on the critical list for a long time two months I had a very good woman who stayed with Andy days We kept house nights And closet doors kept coming open Billings licked his lips The kid was sleeping in the room with me It s funny too Rita asked me once when he was two if I wanted to move him into another room Spock or one of those other quacks claims it s bad for kids to sleep with their parents see Supposed to give them traumas about sex and all that But we never did it unless the kid was asleep And I didn t want to move him I was afraid to after Denny and Shirk But you did move him didn t you Dr Harper asked Yeah Billings said He smiled a sick yellow smile I did Silence again Billings wrestled with it I had to he barked finally I had to It was all right when Rita was there but when she was gone it started to get bolder It started He rolled his eyes at Harper and bared his teeth in a savage grin Oh you won t believe it I know what you think just another goofy for your casebook I know that but you weren t there you lousy smug head-peeper One night every door in the house blew wide open One morning I got up and found a trail of mud and filth across the hall between the coat closet and the front door Was it going out Coming in I don t know Before Jesus I just don t know Records all scratched up and covered with slime mirrors broken and the sounds the sounds He ran a hand through his hair You d wake up at three in the morning and look into the dark and at first you d say It s only the clock But underneath it you could hear something moving in a stealthy way But not too stealthy because it wanted you to hear it A slimy sliding sound like something from the kitchen drain Or a clicking sound like claws being dragged lightly over the staircase banister And you d close your eyes knowing that hearing it was bad but if you saw it And always you d be afraid that the noises might stop for a little while and then there would be a laugh right over your face and a breath of air like stale cabbage on your face and then hands on your throat Billings was pallid and trembling So I moved him I knew it would go for him see Because he was weaker And it did That very first night he screamed in the middle of the night and finally when I got up the cojones to go in he was standing up in bed and screaming The boogeyman Daddy boogeyman wanna go wif Daddy go wif Daddy Billings voice had become a high treble like a child s His eyes seemed to fill his entire face he almost seemed to shrink on the couch But I couldn t the childish breaking treble continued I couldn t And an hour later there was a scream An awful gurgling scream And I knew how much I loved him because I ran in I didn t even turn on the light I ran ran ran oh Jesus God Mary it had him it was shaking him shaking him just like a terrier shakes a piece of cloth and I could see something with awful slumped shoulders and a scarecrow head and I could smell something like a dead mouse in a pop bottle and I heard He trailed off and then his voice clicked back into an adult range I heard it when Andy s neck broke Billings voice was cool and dead It made a sound like ice cracking when you re skating on a country pond in winter Then what happened Oh I ran Billings said in the same cool dead voice I went to an all-night diner How s that for complete cowardice Ran to an all-night diner and drank six cups of coffee Then I went home It was already dawn I called the police even before I went upstairs He was lying on the floor and staring at me Accusing me A tiny bit of blood had run out of one ear Only a drop really And the closet door was open but just a crack The voice stopped Harper looked at the digital clock Fifty minutes had passed Make an appointment with the nurse he said In fact several of them Tuesdays and Thursdays I only came to tell my story Billings said To get it off my chest I lied to the police see Told them the kid must have tried to get out of his crib in the night and they swallowed it Course they did That s just what it looked like Accidental like the others But Rita knew Rita finally knew He covered his eyes with his right arm and began to weep Mr Billings there is a great deal to talk about Dr Harper said after a pause I believe we can remove some of the guilt you ve been carrying but first you have to want to get rid of it Don t you believe I do Billings cried removing his arm from his eyes They were red raw wounded Not yet Harper said quietly Tuesdays and Thursdays After a long silence Billings muttered Goddamn shrink All right All right Make an appointment with the nurse Mr Billings And have a good day Billings laughed emptily and walked out of the office quickly without looking back The nurse s station was empty A small sign on the desk blotter said Back in a Minute Billings turned and went back into the office Doctor your nurse is The room was empty But the closet door was open Just a crack So nice the voice from the closet said So nice The words sounded as if they might have come through a mouthful of rotted seaweed Billings stood rooted to the spot as the closet door swung open He dimly felt warmth at his crotch as he wet himself So nice the boogeyman said as it shambled out It still held its Dr Harper mask in one rotted spade-claw hand GRAY MATTER They had been predicting a norther all week and along about Thursday we got it a real screamer that piled up eight inches by four in the afternoon and showed no signs of slowing down The usual five or six were gathered around the Reliable in Henry s Nite- Owl which is the only little store on this side of Bangor that stays open right around the clock Henry don t do a huge business mostly it amounts to selling the college kids their beer and wine but he gets by and it s a place for us old duffers on Social Security to get together and talk about who s died lately and how the world s going to hell This afternoon Henry was at the counter Bill Pelham Bertie Connors Carl Littlefield and me was tipped up by the stove Outside not a car was moving on Ohio Street and the plows was having hard going The wind was socking drifts across that looked like the backbone on a dinosaur Henry d only had three customers all afternoon that is if you want to count in blind Eddie Eddie s about seventy and he ain t completely blind Runs into things mostly He comes in once or twice a week and sticks a loaf of bread under his coat and walks out with an expression on his face like there you stupid sonsabitches fooled you again Bertie once asked Henry why he never put a stop to it I ll tell you Henry said A few years back the Air Force wanted twenty million dollars to rig up a flyin model of an airplane they had planned out Well it cost them seventy-five million and then the damn thing wouldn t fly That happened ten years ago when blind Eddie and myself were considerably younger and I voted for the woman who sponsored that bill Blind Eddie voted against her And since then I ve been buyin his bread Bertie didn t look like he quite followed all of that but he sat back to muse over it Now the door opened again letting in a blast of the cold gray air outside and a young kid came in stamping snow off his boots I placed him after a second He was Richie Grenadine s kid and he looked like he d just kissed the wrong end of the baby His Adam s apple was going up and down and his face was the color of old oilcloth Mr Parmalee he says to Henry his eyeballs rolling around in his head like ball bearings you got to come You got to take him his beer and come I can t stand to go back there I m scared Now slow down Henry says taking off his white butcher s apron and coming around the counter What s the matter Your dad been on a drunk I realized when he said that that Richie hadn t been in for quite some time Usually he d be by once a day to pick up a case of whatever beer was going cheapest at that time a big fat man with jowls like pork butts and ham-hock arms Richie always was a pig about his beer but he handled it okay when he was working at the sawmill out in Clifton Then something happened a pulper piled a bad load or maybe Richie just made it out that way and Richie was off work free an easy with the sawmill company paying him compensation Something in his back Anyway he got awful fat He hadn t been in lately although once in a while I d seen his boy come in for Richie s nightly case Nice enough boy Henry sold him the beer for he knew it was only the boy doing as his father said He s been on a drunk the boy was saying now but that ain t the trouble It s it s oh Lord it s awful Henry saw he was going to bawl so he says real quick Carl will you watch things for a minute Sure Now Timmy you come back into the stockroom and tell me what s what He led the boy away and Carl went around behind the counter and sat on Henry s stool No one said anything for quite a while We could hear em back there Henry s deep slow voice and then Timmy Grenadine s high one speaking very fast Then the boy commenced to cry and Bill Pelham cleared his throat and started filling up his pipe I ain t seen Richie for a couple months I said Bill grunted No loss He was in oh near the end of October Carl said Near Halloween Bought a case of Schlitz beer He was gettin awful meaty There wasn t much more to say The boy was still crying but he was talking at the same time Outside the wind kept on whooping and yowling and the radio said we d have another six inches or so by morning It was mid-January and it made me wonder if anyone had seen Richie since October besides his boy that is The talking went on for quite a while but finally Henry and the boy came back out The boy had taken his coat off but Henry had put his on The boy was kinda hitching in his chest the way you do when the worst is past but his eyes was red and when he glanced at you he d look down at the floor Henry looked worried I thought I d send Timmy here upstairs an have my wife cook him up a toasted cheese or somethin Maybe a couple of you fellas d like to go around to Richie s place with me Timmy says he wants some beer He gave me the money He tried to smile but it was a pretty sick affair and he soon gave up Sure Bertie says What kind of beer I ll go fetch her Get Harrow s Supreme Henry said We got some cut-down boxes back there I got up too It would have to be Bertie and me Carl s arthritis gets something awful on days like this and Billy Pelham don t have much use of his right arm anymore Bertie got four six-packs of Harrow s and I packed them into a box while Henry took the boy upstairs to the apartment overhead Well he straightened that out with his missus and came back down looking over his shoulder once to make sure the upstairs door was closed Billy spoke up fairly busting What s up Has Richie been workin the kid over No Henry said I d just as soon not say anything just yet It d sound crazy I will show you somethin though The money Timmy had to pay for the beer with He shed four dollar bills out of his pocket holding them by the corner and I don t blame him They was all covered with a gray slimy stuff that looked like the scum on top of bad preserves He laid them down on the counter with a funny smile and said to Carl Don t let anybody touch em Not if what the kid says is even half right And he went around to the sink by the meat counter and washed his hands I got up put on my pea coat and scarf and buttoned up It was no good taking a car Richie lived in an apartment building down on Curve Street which is as close to straight up an down as the law allows and it s the last place the plows touch As we were going out Bill Pelham called after us Watch out now Henry just nodded and put the case of Harrow s on the little handcart he keeps by the door and out we trundled The wind hit us like a sawblade and right away I pulled my scarf up over my ears We paused in the doorway just for a second while Bertie pulled on his gloves He had a pained sort of a wince on his face and I knew how he felt It s all well for younger fellows to go out skiing all day and running those goddamn wasp-wing snowmobiles half the night but when you get up over seventy without an oil change you feel that north-east wind around your heart I don t want to scare you boys Henry said with that queer sort of revolted smile still on his mouth but I m goin to show you this all the same And I m goin to tell you what the boy told me while we walk up there because I want you to know you see And he pulled a caliber hogleg out of his coat pocket the pistol he d kept loaded and ready under the counter ever since he went to twenty-four hours a day back in don t know where he got it but I do know the one time he flashed it at a stickup guy the fella just turned around and bolted right out the door Henry was a cool one all right I saw him throw out a college kid that came in one time and gave him a hard time about cashing a check That kid walked away like his ass was on sideways and he had to crap Well I only tell you that because Henry wanted Bertie and me to know he meant business and we did too So we set out bent into the wind like washerwomen Henry trundling that cart and telling us what the boy had said The wind was trying to rip the words away before we could hear em but we got most of it more n we wanted to I was damn glad Henry had his Frenchman s pecker stowed away in his coat pocket The kid said it must have been the beer you know how you can get a bad can every now and again Flat or smelly or green as the peestains in an Irishman s underwear A fella once told me that all it takes is a tiny hole to let in bacteria that ll do some damn strange things The hole can be so small that the beer won t hardly dribble out but the bacteria can get in And beer s good food for some of those bugs Anyway the kid said Richie brought back a case of Golden Light just like always that night in October and sat down to polish it off while Timmy did his homework Timmy was just about ready for bed when he hears Richie say Christ Jesus that ain t right And Timmy says What s that Pop That beer Richie says God that s the worst taste I ever had in my mouth Most people would wonder why in the name of God he drank it if it tasted so bad but then most people have never seen Richie Grenadine go to his beer I was down in Wally s Spa one afternoon and I saw him win the goddamndest bet He bet a fella he could drink twenty two-bit glasses of beer in one minute Nobody local would take him up but this salesman from Montpelier laid down a twenty-dollar bill and Richie covered him He drank all twenty with seven seconds to spare although when he walked out he was more n three sails into the wind So I expect Richie had most of that bad can in his gut before his brain could warn him I m gonna puke Richie says Look out But by the time he got to the head it had passed off and that was the end of it The boy said he smelt the can and it smelt like something crawled in there and died There was a little gray dribble around the top too Two days later the boy comes home from school and there s Richie sitting in front of the TV and watching the afternoon tearjerkers with every goddamn shade in the place pulled down What s up Timmy asks for Richie don t hardly ever roll in before nine I m watchin the TV Richie says I didn t seem to want to go out today Timmy turned on the light over the sink and Richie yelled at him And turn off that friggin light So Timmy did not asking how he s gonna do his homework in the dark When Richie s in that mood you don t ask him nothing An go out an get me a case Richie says Money s on the table When the kid gets back his dad s still sitting in the dark only now it s dark outside too And the TV s off The kid starts getting the creeps well who wouldn t Nothing but a dark flat and your daddy setting in the corner like a big lump So he puts the beer on the table knowing that Richie don t like it so cold it spikes his forehead and when he gets close to his old man he starts to notice a kind of rotten smell like an old cheese someone left standing on the counter over the weekend He don t say shit or go blind though as the old man was never what you d call a cleanly soul Instead he goes into his room and shuts the door and does his homework and after a while he hears the TV start to go and Richie s popping the top in his first of the evening And for two weeks or so that s the way things went The kid got up in the morning and went to school an when he got home Richie d be in front of the television and beer money on the table The flat was smelling ranker and ranker too Richie wouldn t have the shades up at all and about the middle of November he made Timmy stop studying in his room Said he couldn t abide the light under the door So Timmy started going down the block to a friend s house after getting his dad the beer Then one day when Timmy came home from school it was four o clock and pretty near dark already Richie says Turn on the light The kid turns on the light over the sink and damn if Richie ain t all wrapped up in a blanket Look Richie says and one hand creeps out from under the blanket Only it ain t a hand at all Something gray is all the kid could tell Henry Didn t look like a hand at all Just a gray lump Well Timmy Grenadine was scared bad He says Pop what s happening to you And Richie says I dunno But it don t hurt It feels kinda nice So Timmy says I m gonna call Dr Westphail And the blanket starts to tremble all over like something awful was shaking all over under there And Richie says Don t you dare If you do I ll touch ya and you ll end up just like this And he slides the blanket down over his face for just a minute By then we were up to the corner of Harlow and Curve Street and I was even colder than the temperature had been on Henry s Orange Crush thermometer when we came out A person doesn t hardly want to believe such things and yet there s still strange things in the world I once knew a fella named George Kelso who worked for the Bangor Public Works Department He spent fifteen years fixing water mains and mending electricity cables and all that an then one day he just up an quit not two years before his retirement Frankie Haldeman who knew him said George went down into a sewer pipe on Essex laughing and joking just like always and came up fifteen minutes later with his hair just as white as snow and his eyes staring like he just looked through a window into hell He walked straight down to the BPW garage and punched his clock and went down to Wally s Spa and started drinking It killed him two years later Frankie said he tried to talk to him about it and George said something one time and that was when he was pretty well blotto Turned around on his stool George did an asked Frankie Haldeman if he d ever seen a spider as big as a good-sized dog setting in a web full of kitties an such all wrapped up in silk thread Well what could he say to that I m not saying there s any truth in it but I am saying that there s things in the corners of the world that would drive a man insane to look em right in the face So we just stood on the corner a minute in spite of the wind that was whooping up the street What d he see Bertie asked He said he could still see his dad Henry answered but he said it was like he was buried in gray jelly and it was all kinda mashed together He said his clothes were all stickin in and out of his skin like they was melted to his body Holy Jesus Bertie said Then he covered right up again and started screaming at the kid to turn off the light Like he was a fungus I said Yes Henry said Sorta like that You keep that pistol handy Bertie said Yes I think I will And with that we started to trundle up Curve Street The apartment house where Richie Grenadine had his flat was almost at the top of the hill one of those big Victorian monsters that were built by the pulp an paper barons at the turn of the century They ve just about all been turned into apartment houses now When Bertie got his breath he told us Richie lived on the third floor under that top gable that jutted out like an eyebrow I took the chance to ask Henry what happened to the kid after that Along about the third week in November the kid came back one afternoon to find Richie had gone one further than just pulling the shades down He d taken and nailed blankets across every window in the place It was starting to stink worse too kind of a mushy stink the way fruit gets when it goes to ferment with yeast A week or so after that Richie got the kid to start heating his beer on the stove Can you feature that The kid all by himself in that apartment with his dad turning into well into something an heating his beer and then having to listen to him it drinking it with awful thick slurping sounds the way an old man eats his chowder Can you imagine it And that s the way things went on until today when the kid s school let out early because of the storm The boy says he went right home Henry told us There s no light in the upstairs hall at all the boy claims his dad musta snuck out some night and broke it so he had to sort of creep down to his door Well he heard somethin moving around in there and it suddenly pops into his mind that he don t know what Richie does all day through the week He ain t seen his dad stir out of that chair for almost a month and a man s got to sleep and go to the bathroom sometime There s a Judas hole in the middle of the door and it s supposed to have a latch on the inside to fasten it shut but it s been busted ever since they lived there So the kid slides up to the door real easy and pushed it open a bit with his thumb and pokes his eye up to it By now we were at the foot of the steps and the house was looming over us like a high ugly face with those windows on the third floor for eyes I looked up there and sure enough those two windows were just as black as pitch Like somebody d put blankets over em or painted em up It took him a minute to get his eye adjusted to the gloom An then he seen a great big gray lump not like a man at all slitherin over the floor leavin a gray slimy trail behind it An then it sort of snaked out an arm or something like an arm and pried a board off n the wall And took out a cat Henry stopped for a second Bertie was beating his hands together and it was god-awful cold out there on the street but none of us was ready to go up just yet A dead cat Henry recommenced that had putrefacted The boy said it looked all swole up stiff and there was little white things crawlin all over it Stop Bertie said For Christ s sake And then his dad ate it I tried to swallow and something tasted greasy in my throat That s when Timmy closed the peephole Henry finished softly And ran I don t think I can go up there Bertie said Henry didn t say nothing just looked from Bertie to me and back again I guess we better I said We got Richie s beer Bertie didn t say anything to that so we went up the steps and in through the front hall door I smelled it right off Do you know how a cider house smells in summer You never get the smell of apples out but in the fall it s all right because it smells tangy and sharp enough to ream your nose right out But in the summer it just smells mean this smell was like that but a little bit worse There was one light on in the lower hall a mean yellow thing in a frosted glass that threw a glow as thin as buttermilk And those stairs that went up into the shadows Henry bumped the cart to a stop and while he was lifting out the case of beer I thumbed the button at the foot of the stairs that controlled the second-floor-landing bulb But it was busted just as the boy said Bertie quavered I ll lug the beer You just take care of that pistol Henry didn t argue He handed it over and we started up Henry first then me then Bertie with the case in his arms By the time we had fetched the second-floor landing the stink was just that much worse Rotted apples all fermented and under that an even uglier stink When I lived out in Levant I had a dog one time Rex his name was and he was a good mutt but not very wise about cars He got hit a lick one afternoon while I was at work and he crawled under the house and died there My Christ what a stink I finally had to go under and haul him out with a pole That other stench was like that flyblown and putrid and just as dirty as a borin cob Up till then I had kept thinking that maybe it was some sort of joke but I saw it wasn t Lord why don t the neighbors kick up Harry I asked What neighbors Henry asked and he was smiling that queer smile again I looked around and saw that the hall had a sort of dusty unused look and the door of all three second-floor apartments was closed and locked up Who s the landlord I wonder Bertie asked resting the case on the newel post and getting his breath Gaiteau Surprised he don t kick im out Who d go up there and evict him Henry asked You Bertie didn t say nothing Presently we started up the next flight which was even narrower and steeper than the last It was getting hotter too It sounded like every radiator in the place was clanking and hissing The smell was awful and I started to feel like someone was stirring my guts with a stick At the top was a short hall and one door with a little Judas hole in the middle of it Bertie made a soft little cry an whispered out Look what we re walkin in I looked down and saw all this slimy stuff on the hall floor in little puddles It looked like there d been a carpet once but the gray stuff had eaten it all away Henry walked down to the door and we went after him I don t know about Bertie but I was shaking in my shoes Henry never hesitated though he raised up that gun and beat on the door with the butt of it Richie he called and his voice didn t sound a bit scared although his face was deadly pale This is Henry Parmalee from down at the Nite-Owl I brought your beer There wasn t any answer for p raps a full minute and then a voice said Where s Timmy Where s my boy I almost ran right then That voice wasn t human at all It was queer an low an bubbly like someone talking through a mouthful of suet He s at my store Henry said havin a decent meal He s just as skinny as a slat cat Richie There wasn t nothing for a while and then some horrible squishing noises like a man in mbber boots walking through mud Then that decayed voice spoke right through the other side of the door Open the door an shove that beer through it said Only you got to pull all the ring tabs first I can t In a minute Henry said What kind of shape you in Richie Never mind that the voice said and it was horribly eager Just push in the beer and go It ain t just dead cats anymore is it Henry said and he sounded sad He wasn t holdin the gun butt-up anymore now it was business end first And suddenly in a flash of light I made the mental connection Henry had already made perhaps even as Timmy was telling his story The smell of decay and rot seemed to double in my nostrils when I remembered Two young girls and some old Salvation Army wino had disappeared in town during the last three weeks or so all after dark Send it in or I ll come out an get it the voice said Henry gestured us back and we went I guess you better Richie He cocked his piece There was nothing then not for a long time To tell the truth I began to feel as if it was all over Then that door burst open so sudden and so hard that it actually bulged before slamming out against the wall And out came Richie It was just a second just a second before Bertie and me was down those stairs like schoolkids four an five at a time and out the door into the snow slipping an sliding Going down we heard Henry fire three times the reports loud as grenades in the closed hallways of that empty cursed house What we saw in that one or two seconds will last me a lifetime or whatever s left of it It was like a huge gray wave of jelly jelly that looked like a man and leaving a trail of slime behind it But that wasn t the worst Its eyes were flat and yellow and wild with no human soul in em Only there wasn t two There were four an right down the center of the thing betwixt the two pairs of eyes was a white fibrous line with a kind of pulsing pink flesh showing through like a slit in a hog s belly It was dividing you see Dividing in two Bertie and I didn t say nothing to each other going back to the store I don t know what was going through his mind but I know well enough what was in mine the multiplication table Two times two is four four times two is eight eight times two is sixteen sixteen times two is We got back Carl and Bill Pelham jumped up and started asking questions right off We wouldn t answer neither of us We just turned around and waited to see if Henry was gonna walk in outta the snow I was up to times two is the end of the human race and so we sat there cozied up to all that beer and waited to see which one was going to finally come back and here we still sit I hope it s Henry I surely do BATTLEGROUND Mr Renshaw The desk clerk s voice caught him halfway to the elevator and Renshaw turned back impatiently shifting his flight bag from one hand to the other The envelope in his coat pocket stuffed with twenties and fifties crackled heavily The job had gone well and the pay had been excellent even after the Organization s percent finder s fee had been skimmed off the top Now all he wanted was a hot shower and a gin and tonic and sleep What is it Package sir Would you sign the slip Renshaw signed and looked thoughtfully at the rectangular package His name and the building s address were written on the gummed label in a spiky backhand script that seemed familiar He rocked the package on the imitation-marble surface of the desk and something clanked faintly inside Should I have that sent up Mr Renshaw No I ve got it It was about eighteen inches on a side and fitted clumsily under his arm He put it on the plush carpet that covered the elevator floor and twisted his key in the penthouse slot above the regular rack of buttons The car rose smoothly and silently He closed his eyes and let the job replay itself on the dark screen of his mind First as always a call from Cal Bates You available Johnny He was available twice a year minimum fee He was very good very reliable but what his customers really paid for was the infallible predator s talent John Renshaw was a human hawk constructed by both genetics and environment to do two things superbly kill and survive After Bates s call a buff-colored envelope appeared in Renshaw s box A name an address a photograph All committed to memory then down the garbage disposal with the ashes of envelope and contents This time the face had been that of a sallow Miami businessman named Hans Morris founder and owner of the Morris Toy Company Someone had wanted Morris out of the way and had gone to the Organization The Organization in the person of Calvin Bates had talked to John Renshaw Pow Mourners please omit flowers The doors slid open he picked up his package and stepped out He unlocked the suite and stepped in At this time of day just after p m the spacious living room was splashed with April sunshine He paused for a moment enjoying it then put the package on the end table by the door and loosened his tie He dropped the envelope on top of it and walked over to the terrace He pushed open the sliding glass door and stepped out It was cold and the wind knifed through his thin topcoat Yet he paused a moment looking over the city the way a general might survey a captured country Traffic crawled beetlelike in the streets Far away almost buried in the golden afternoon haze the Bay Bridge glittered like a madman s mirage To the east all but lost behind the downtown high rises the crammed and dirty tenements with their stainless-steel forests of TV aerials It was better up here Better than in the gutters He went back inside slid the door closed and went into the bathroom for a long hot shower When he sat down forty minutes later to regard his package drink in hand the shadows had marched halfway across the wine-colored carpet and the best of the afternoon was past It was a bomb Of course it wasn t but one proceeded as if it were That was why one had remained upright and taking nourishment while so many others had gone to that great unemployment office in the sky If it was a bomb it was clockless It sat utterly silent bland and enigmatic Plastique was more likely these days anyway Less temperamental than the clocksprings manufactured by Westclox and Big Ben Renshaw looked at the postmark Miami April Five days ago So the bomb was not time-set It would have gone off in the hotel safe in that case Miami Yes And that spiky backhand writing There had been a framed photograph on the sallow businessman s desk The photo had been of an even sallower old crone wearing a babushka The script slanted across the bottom had read Best from your number-one idea girl Mom What kind of a number-one idea is this Mom A do-it-yourself extermination kit He regarded the package with complete concentration not moving his hands folded Extraneous questions such as how Morris number-one idea girl might have discovered his address did not occur to him They were for later for Cal Bates Unimportant now With a sudden almost absent move he took a small celluloid calendar out of his wallet and inserted it deftly under the twine that crisscrossed the brown paper He slid it under the Scotch tape that held one end flap The flap came loose relaxing against the twine He paused for a time observing then leaned close and sniffed Cardboard paper string Nothing more He walked around the box squatted easily on his haunches and repeated the process Twilight was invading his apartment with gray shadowy fingers One of the flaps popped free of the restraining twine showing a dull green box beneath Metal Hinged He produced a pocket knife and cut the twine It fell away and a few helping prods with the tip of the knife revealed the box It was green with black markings and stenciled on the front in white letters were the words g i joe Vietnam footlocker Below that Infantrymen Helicopters BAR Men Bazooka Men Medics Jeeps Below that a flag decal Below that in the corner Morris Toy Company Miami Fla He reached out to touch it then withdrew his hand Something inside the footlocker had moved Renshaw stood up not hurrying and backed across the room toward the kitchen and the hall He snapped on the lights The Vietnam Footlocker was rocking making the brown paper beneath it rattle It suddenly overbalanced and fell to the carpet with a soft thud landing on one end The hinged top opened a crack of perhaps two inches Tiny foot soldiers about an inch and a half tall began to crawl out Renshaw watched them unblinking His mind made no effort to cope with the real or unreal aspect of what he was seeing only with the possible consequences for his survival The soldiers were wearing minuscule army fatigues helmets and field packs Tiny carbines were slung across their shoulders Two of them looked briefly across the room at Renshaw Their eyes no bigger than pencil points glittered Five ten twelve then all twenty One of them was gesturing ordering the others They lined themselves up along the crack that the fall had produced and began to push The crack began to widen Renshaw picked one of the large pillows off the couch and began to walk toward them The commanding officer turned and gestured The others whirled and unslung their carbines There were tiny almost delicate popping sounds and Renshaw felt suddenly as if he had been stung by bees He threw the pillow It struck them knocking them sprawling then hit the box and knocked it wide open Insectlike with a faint high whirring noise like chiggers a cloud of miniature helicopters painted jungle green rose out of the box Tiny phut phut sounds reached Renshaw s ears and he saw pinprick-sized muzzle flashes coming from the open copter doors Needles pricked his belly his right arm the side of his neck He clawed out and got one sudden pain in his fingers blood welling The whirling blades had chopped them to the bone in diagonal scarlet hash marks The others whirled out of range circling him like horseflies The stricken copter thumped to the rug and lay still Sudden excruciating pain in his foot made him cry out One of the foot soldiers was standing on his shoe and bayoneting his ankle The tiny face looked up panting and grinning Renshaw kicked at it and the tiny body flew across the room to splatter on the wall It did not leave blood but a viscid purple smear There was a tiny coughing explosion and blinding agony ripped his thigh One of the bazooka men had come out of the footlocker A small curl of smoke rose lazily from his weapon Renshaw looked down at his leg and saw a blackened smoking hole in his pants the size of a quarter The flesh beneath was charred The little bastard shot me He turned and ran into the hall then into his bedroom One of the helicopters buzzed past his cheek blades whirring busily The small stutter of a BAR Then it darted away The gun beneath his pillow was a Magnum big enough to put a hole the size of two fists through anything it hit Renshaw turned holding the pistol in both hands He realized coolly that he would be shooting at a moving target not much bigger than a flying light bulb Two of the copters whirred in Sitting on the bed Renshaw fired once One of the helicopters exploded into nothingness That s two he thought He drew a bead on the second squeezed the trigger It jigged Goddamnit it jigged The helicopter swooped at him in a sudden deadly arc fore and aft overhead props whirring with blinding speed Renshaw caught a glimpse of one of the BAR men crouched at the open bay door firing his weapon in short deadly bursts and then he threw himself to the floor and rolled My eyes the bastard was going for my eyes He came up on his back at the far wall the gun held at chest level But the copter was retreating It seemed to pause for a moment and dip in recognition of Renshaw s superior firepower Then it was gone back toward the living room Renshaw got up wincing as his weight came down on the wounded leg It was bleeding freely And why not he thought grimly It s not everybody who gets hit point-blank with a bazooka shell and lives to tell about it So Mom was his number-one idea girl was she She was all that and a bit more He shook a pillowcase free of the tick and ripped it into a bandage for his leg then took his shaving mirror from the bureau and went to the hallway door Kneeling he shoved it out onto the carpet at an angle and peered in They were bivouacking by the footlocker damned if they weren t Miniature soldiers ran hither and thither setting up tents Jeeps two inches high raced about importantly A medic was working over the soldier Renshaw had kicked The remaining eight copters flew in a protective swarm overhead at coffee-table level Suddenly they became aware of the mirror and three of the foot soldiers dropped to one knee and began firing Seconds later the mirror shattered in four places Okay okay then Renshaw went back to the bureau and got the heavy mahogany odds-and-ends box Linda had given him for Christmas He hefted it once nodded and went to the doorway and lunged through He wound up and fired like a pitcher throwing a fast ball The box described a swift true vector and smashed little men like ninepins One of the jeeps rolled over twice Renshaw advanced to the doorway of the living room sighted on one of the sprawling soldiers and gave it to him Several of the others had recovered Some were kneeling and firing formally Others had taken cover Still others had retreated back into the footlocker The bee stings began to pepper his legs and torso but none reached higher than his rib cage Perhaps the range was too great It didn t matter he had no intention of being turned away This was it He missed with his next shot they were so goddamn small but the following one sent another soldier into a broken sprawl The copters were buzzing toward him ferociously Now the tiny bullets began to splat into his face above and below his eyes He potted the lead copter then the second Jagged streaks of pain silvered his vision The remaining six split into two retreating wings His face was wet with blood and he swiped at it with his forearm He was ready to start firing again when he paused The soldiers who had retreated inside the footlocker were trundling something out Something that looked like There was a blinding sizzle of yellow fire and a sudden gout of wood and plaster exploded from the wall to his left a rocket launcher He squeezed off one shot at it missed wheeled and ran for the bathroom at the far end of the corridor He slammed the door and locked it In the bathroom mirror an Indian was staring back at him with dazed and haunted eyes a battle-crazed Indian with thin streamers of red paint drawn from holes no bigger than grains of pepper A ragged flap of skin dangled from one cheek There was a gouged furrow in his neck I m losing He ran a shaking hand through his hair The front door was cut off So was the phone and the kitchen extension They had a goddamn rocket launcher and a direct hit would tear his head off Damn it that xvasn t even listed on the box He started to draw in a long breath and let it out in a sudden grunt as a fist-sized section of the door blew in with a charred burst of wood Tiny flames glowed briefly around the ragged edges of the hole and he saw the brilliant flash as they launched another round More wood blew inward scattering burning slivers on the bathroom rug He stamped them out and two of the copters buzzed angrily through the hole Minuscule BAR slugs stitched his chest With a whining groan of rage he smashed one out of the air barehanded sustaining a picket fence of deep slashes across his palm In sudden desperate invention he slung a heavy bath towel over the other It fell writhing to the floor and he stamped the life out of it His breath was coming in hoarse whoops Blood ran into one eye hot and stinging and he wiped it away There goddamnit There That ll make them think Indeed it did seem to be making them think There was no movement for fifteen minutes Renshaw sat on the edge of the tub thinking feverishly There had to be a way out of this blind alley There had to be If there was only a way to flank them He suddenly turned and looked at the small window over the tub There was a way Of course there was His eyes dropped to the can of lighter fluid on top of the medicine cabinet He was reaching for it when the rustling noise came He whirled bringing the Magnum up but it was only a tiny scrap of paper shoved under the crack of the door The crack Renshaw noted grimly was too narrow for even one of them to get through There was one tiny word written on the paper Surrender Renshaw smiled grimly and put the lighter fluid in his breast pocket There was a chewed stub of pencil beside it He scrawled one word on the paper and shoved it back under the door The word was NUTS There was a sudden blinding barrage of rocket shells and Renshaw backed away They arched through the hole in the door and detonated against the pale blue tiles above the towel rack turning the elegant wall into a pocket lunar landscape Renshaw threw a hand over his eyes as plaster flew in a hot rain of shrapnel Burning holes ripped through his shirt and his back was peppered When the barrage stopped Renshaw moved He climbed on top of the tub and slid the window open Cold stars looked in at him It was a narrow window and a narrow ledge beyond it But there was no time to think of that He boosted himself through and the cold air slapped his lacerated face and neck like an open hand He was leaning over the balance point of his hands staring straight down Forty stories down From this height the street looked no wider than a child s train track The bright winking lights of the city glittered madly below him like thrown jewels With the deceptive ease of a trained gymnast Renshaw brought his knees up to rest on the lower edge of the window If one of those wasp-sized copters flew through that hole in the door now one shot in the ass would send him straight down screaming all the way None did He twisted thrust one leg out and one reaching hand grabbed the overhead cornice and held A moment later he was standing on the ledge outside the window Deliberately not thinking of the horrifying drop below his heels not thinking of what would happen if one of the helicopters buzzed out after him Renshaw edged toward the corner of the building Fifteen feet ten There He paused his chest pressed against the wall hands splayed out on the rough surface He could feel the lighter fluid in his breast pocket and the reassuring weight of the Magnum jammed in his waistband Now to get around the goddamn corner Gently he eased one foot around and slid his weight onto it Now the right angle was pressed razorlike into his chest and gut There was a smear of bird guano in front of his eyes on the rough stone Christ he thought crazily I didn t know they could fly this high His left foot slipped For a weird timeless moment he tottered over the brink right arm backwatering madly for balance and then he was clutching the two sides of the building in a lover s embrace face pressed against the hard corner breath shuddering in and out of his lungs A bit at a time he slid the other foot around Thirty feet away his own living-room terrace jutted out He made his way down to it breath sliding in and out of his lungs with shallow force Twice he was forced to stop as sharp gusts of wind tried to pick him off the ledge Then he was there gripping the ornamented iron railings He hoisted himself over noiselessly He had left the curtains half drawn across the sliding glass partition and now he peered in cautiously They were just the way he wanted them ass to Four soldiers and one copter had been left to guard the footlocker The rest would be outside the bathroom door with the rocket launcher Okay In through the opening like gangbusters Wipe out the ones by the footlocker then out the door Then a quick taxi to the airport Off to Miami to find Morris number- one idea girl He thought he might just burn her face off with a flame thrower That would be poetic justice He took off his shirt and ripped a long strip from one sleeve He dropped the rest to flutter limply by his feet and bit off the plastic spout on the can of lighter fluid He stuffed one end of the rag inside withdrew it and stuffed the other end in so only a six-inch strip of saturated cotton hung free He got out his lighter took a deep breath and thumbed the wheel He tipped it to the cloth and as it sprang alight he rammed open the glass partition and plunged through The copter reacted instantly kamikaze-diving him as he charged across the rug dripping tiny splatters of liquid fire Renshaw straight-armed it hardly noticing the jolt of pain that ran up his arm as the turning blades chopped his flesh open The tiny foot soldiers scattered into the footlocker After that it all happened very rapidly Renshaw threw the lighter fluid The can caught mushrooming into a licking fireball The next instant he was reversing running for the door He never knew what hit him It was like the thud that a steel safe would make when dropped from a respectable height Only this thud ran through the entire high-rise apartment building thrumming in its steel frame like a tuning fork The penthouse door blew off its hinges and shattered against the far wall A couple who had been walking hand in hand below looked up in time to see a very large white flash as though a hundred flashguns had gone off at once Somebody blew a fuse the man said I guess What s that his girl asked Something was fluttering lazily down toward them he caught it in one outstretched hand Jesus some guy s shirt All full of little holes Bloody too I don t like it she said nervously Call a cab huh Ralph We ll have to talk to the cops if something happened up there and I ain t supposed to be out with you Sure yeah He looked around saw a taxi and whistled Its brake lights flared and they ran across to get it Behind them unseen a tiny scrap of paper floated down and landed near the remains of John Renshaw s shirt Spiky backhand script read Hey kids Special in this Vietnam Footlocker For a Limited Time Only Rocket Launcher Surface-to-Air Twister Missiles Scale-Model Thermonuclear Weapon TRUCKS The guy s name was Snodgrass and I could see him getting ready to do something crazy His eyes had gotten bigger showing a lot of the whites like a dog getting ready to fight The two kids who had come skidding into the parking lot in the old Fury were trying to talk to him but his head was cocked as though he was hearing other voices He had a tight little pot-belly encased in a good suit that was getting a little shiny in the seat He was a salesman and he kept his display bag close to him like a pet dog that had gone to sleep Try the radio again the truck driver at the counter said The short-order cook shrugged and turned it on He flipped it across the band and got nothing but static You went too fast the tmcker protested You might have missed something Hell the short-order cook said He was an elderly black man with a smile of gold and he wasn t looking at the trucker He was looking through the diner-length picture window at the parking lot Seven or eight heavy trucks were out there engines rumbling in low idling roars that sounded like big cats purring There were a couple of Macks a Hemingway and four or five Reos Trailer trucks interstate haulers with a lot of license plates and CB whip antennas on the back The kids Fury was lying on its roof at the end of long looping skid marks in the loose crushed rock of the parking lot It had been battered into senseless junk At the entrance to the truck stop s turnaround there was a blasted Cadillac Its owner stared out of the star- shattered windshield like a gutted fish Horn-rimmed glasses hung from one ear Halfway across the lot from it lay the body of a girl in a pink dress She had jumped from the Caddy when she saw it wasn t going to make it She had hit running but never had a chance She was the worst even though she was face down There were flies around her in clouds Across the road an old Ford station wagon had been slammed through the guardrails That had happened an hour ago No one had been by since then You couldn t see the turnpike from the window and the phone was out You went too fast the tmcker was protesting You oughta That was when Snodgrass bolted He turned the table over getting up smashing coffee cups and sending sugar in a wild spray His eyes were wilder than ever and his mouth hung loosely and he was blabbering We gotta get outta here we gotta getouttahere wegottagetouttahere The kid shouted and his girl friend screamed I was on the stool closest to the door and I got a handful of his shirt but he tore loose He was cranked up all the way He would have gone through a bank-vault door He slammed out the door and then he was sprinting across the gravel toward the drainage ditch on the left Two of the trucks lunged after him smokestacks blowing diesel exhaust dark brown against the sky huge rear wheels machine-gunning gravel up in sprays He couldn t have been any more than five or six running steps from the edge of the flat parking lot when he turned back to look fear scrawled on his face His feet tangled each other and he faltered and almost fell down He got his balance again but it was too late One of the trucks gave way and the other charged down huge front grill glittering savagely in the sun Snodgrass screamed the sound high and thin nearly lost under the Reo s heavy diesel roar It didn t drag him under As things turned out it would have been better if it had Instead it drove him up and out the way a punter kicks a football For a moment he was silhouetted against the hot afternoon sky like a crippled scarecrow and then he was gone into the drainage ditch The big truck s brakes hissed like dragon s breath its front wheels locked digging grooves into the gravel skin of the lot and it stopped inches from jackknifing in The bastard The girl in the booth screamed Both hands were clamped into her cheeks dragging the flesh down turning it into a witch s mask Glass broke I turned my head and saw that the trucker had squeezed his glass hard enough to break it I don t think he knew it yet Milk and a few drops of blood fell onto the counter The black counterman was frozen by the radio a dishcloth in hand looking amazed His teeth glittered For a moment there was no sound but the buzzing Westclox and the rumbling of the Reo s engine as it returned to its fellows Then the girl began to cry and it was all right or at least better My own car was around the side also battered to junk It was a Camaro and I had still been paying on it but I didn t suppose that mattered now There was no one in the trucks The sun glittered and flashed on empty cabs The wheels turned themselves You couldn t think about it too much You d go insane if you thought about it too much Like Snodgrass Two hours passed The sun began to go down Outside the trucks patrolled in slow circles and figure eights Their parking lights and running lights had come on I walked the length of the counter twice to get the kinks out of my legs and then sat in a booth by the long front window It was a standard truck stop close to the major thruway a complete service facility out back gas and diesel fuel both The truckers came here for coffee and pie Mister The voice was hesitant I looked around It was the two kids from the Fury The boy looked about nineteen He had long hair and a beard that was just starting to take hold His girl looked younger Yeah What happened to you I shrugged I was coming up the interstate to Pelson I said A tmck came up behind me I could see it in the mirror a long way off really highballing You could hear it a mile down the road It whipped out around a VW Beetle and just snapped it off the road with the whiplash of the trailer the way you d snap a ball of paper off a table with your finger I thought the truck would go too No driver could have held it with the trailer whipping that way But it didn t go The VW flopped over six or seven times and exploded And the truck got the next one coming up the same way It was coming up on me and I took the exit ramp in a hurry I laughed but my heart wasn t in it Right into a truck stop of all places From the frying pan into the fire The girl swallowed We saw a Greyhound going north in the southbound lane It was plowing through cars It exploded and burned but before it did slaughter A Greyhound bus That was something new And bad Outside all the headlights suddenly popped on in unison bathing the lot in an eerie depthless glare Growling they cruised back and forth The headlights seemed to give them eyes and in the growing gloom the dark trailer boxes looked like the hunched squared-off shoulders of prehistoric giants The counterman said Is it safe to turn on the lights Do it I said and find out He flipped the switches and a series of flyspecked globes overhead came on At the same time a neon sign out front stuttered into life Conant s Tmck Stop Diner Good Eats Nothing happened The trucks continued their patrol I can t understand it the trucker said He had gotten down from his stool and was walking around his hand wrapped in a red engineer s bandanna I ain t had no problems with my rig She s a good old girl I pulled in here a little past one for a spaghetti dinner and this happens He waved his arms and the bandanna flapped My own rig s out there right now the one with the weak left taillight Been driving her for six years But if I stepped out that door It s just starting the counterman said His eyes were hooded and obsidian It must be bad if that radio s gone It s just starting The girl had drained as pale as milk Never mind that I said to the counterman Not yet What would do it The trucker was worrying Electrical storms in the atmosphere Nuclear testing What Maybe they re mad I said Around seven o clock I walked over to the counterman How are we fixed here I mean if we have to stay awhile His brow wrinkled Not so bad Yest y was delivery day We got two-three hunnert hamburg patties canned fruit and vegetables dry cereal aigs no more milk than what s in the cooler but the water s from the well If we had to the five of us cud get on for a month or more The trucker came over and blinked at us I m dead out of cigarettes Now that cigarette machine It ain t my machine the counterman said No sir The trucker had a steel pinch bar he d gotten in the supply room out back He went to work on the machine The kid went down to where the jukebox glittered and flashed and plugged in a quarter John Fogarty began to sing about being born on the bayou I sat down and looked out the window I saw something I didn t like right away A Chevy light pickup had joined the patrol like a Shetland pony amid Percherons I watched it until it rolled impartially over the body of the girl from the Caddy and then I looked away We made them the girl cried out with sudden wretchedness They can t Her boy friend told her to hush The trucker got the cigarette machine open and helped himself to six or eight packs of Viceroys He put them in different pockets and then ripped one pack open From the intent expression on his face I wasn t sure if he was going to smoke them or eat them up Another record came on the juke It was eight o clock At eight-thirty the power went off When the lights went the girl screamed a cry that stopped suddenly as if her boy friend had put his hand over her mouth The jukebox died with a deepening unwinding sound What the Christ the trucker said Counterman I called You got any candles I think so Wait yeah Here s a few I got up and took them We lit them and started placing them around Be careful I said If we burn the place down there s the devil to pay He chuckled morosely You know it When we were done placing the candles the kid and his girl were huddled together and the trucker was by the back door watching six more heavy trucks weaving in and out between the concrete fuel islands This changes things doesn t it I said Damn right if the power s gone for good How bad Hamburg ll go over in three days Rest of the meat and aigs ll go by about as quick The cans will be okay an the dry stuff But that ain t the worst We ain t gonna have no water without the pump How long Without no water A week Fill every empty jug you ve got Fill them till you can t draw anything but air Where are the toilets There s good water in the tanks Employees res room is in the back But you have to go outside to get to the lady s and gent s Across to the service building I wasn t ready for that Not yet No Out the side door an up a ways Give me a couple of buckets He found two galvanized pails The kid strolled up What are you doing We have to have water All we can get Give me a bucket then I handed him one Jerry the girl cried You He looked at her and she didn t say anything else but she picked up a napkin and began to tear at the corners The trucker was smoking another cigarette and grinning at the floor He didn t speak up We walked over to the side door where I d come in that afternoon and stood there for a second watching the shadows wax and wane as the trucks went back and forth Now the kid said His arm brushed mine and the muscles were jumping and humming like wires If anyone bumped him he d go straight up to heaven Relax I said He smiled a little It was a sick smile but better than none Okay We slipped out The night air had cooled Crickets chirred in the grass and frogs thumped and croaked in the drainage ditch Out here the rumble of the trucks was louder more menacing the sound of beasts From inside it was a movie Out here it was real you could get killed We slid along the tiled outer wall A slight overhang gave us some shadow My Camaro was huddled against the cyclone fence across from us and faint light from the roadside sign glinted on broken metal and puddles of gas and oil You take the lady s I whispered Fill your bucket from the toilet tank and wait Steady diesel rumblings It was tricky you thought they were coming but it was only echoes bouncing off the building s odd corners It was only twenty feet but it seemed much farther He opened the lady s-room door and went in I went past and then I was inside the gent s I could feel my muscles loosen and a breath whistled out of me I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror strained white face with dark eyes I got the porcelain tank cover off and dunked the bucket full I poured a little back to keep from sloshing and went to the door Hey Yeah he breathed You ready Yeah We went out again We got maybe six steps before lights blared in our faces It had crept up big wheels barely turning on the gravel It had been lying in wait and now it leaped at us electric headlamps glowing in savage circles the huge chrome grill seeming to snarl The kid froze his face stamped with horror his eyes blank the pupils dilated down to pinpricks I gave him a hard shove spilling half his water Go The thunder of that diesel engine rose to a shriek I reached over the kid s shoulder to yank the door open but before I could it was shoved from inside The kid lunged in and I dodged after him I looked back to see the truck a big cab-over Peterbilt kiss off the tiled outside wall peeling away jagged hunks of tile There was an ear-grinding squealing noise like gigantic fingers scraping a blackboard Then the right mudguard and the corners of the grill smashed into the still-open door sending glass in a crystal spray and snapping the door s steel-gauge hinges like tissue paper The door flew into the night like something out of a Dali painting and the truck accelerated toward the front parking lot its exhaust racketing like machine-gun fire It had a disappointed angry sound The kid put his bucket down and collapsed into the girl s arms shuddering My heart was thudding heavily in my chest and my calves felt like water And speaking of water we had brought back about a bucket and a quarter between us It hardly seemed worth it I want to block up that doorway I said to the counterman What will do the trick Well The trucker broke in Why One of those big trucks couldn t get a wheel in through there It s not the big trucks I m worried about The trucker began hunting for a smoke We got some sheet sidin out in the supply room the counterman said Boss was gonna put up a shed to store butane gas We ll put them across and prop them with a couple of booths It ll help the trucker said It took about an hour and by the end we d all gotten into the act even the girl It was fairly solid Of course fairly solid wasn t going to be good enough not if something hit it at full speed I think they all knew that There were still three booths ranged along the big glass picture window and I sat down in one of them The clock behind the counter had stopped at but it felt like ten Outside the trucks prowled and growled Some left hurrying off to unknown missions and others came There were three pickup trucks now circling importantly amid their bigger brothers I was starting to doze and instead of counting sheep I counted trucks How many in the state how many in America Trailer trucks pickup trucks flatbeds day-haulers three- quarter-tons army convoy trucks by the tens of thousands and buses Nightmare vision of a city bus two wheels in the gutter and two wheels on the pavement roaring along and plowing through screaming pedestrians like ninepins I shook it off and fell into a light troubled sleep It must have been early morning when Snodgrass began to scream A thin new moon had risen and was shining icily through a high scud of cloud A new clattering note had been added counterpointing the throaty idling roar of the big rigs I looked for it and saw a hay baler circling out by the darkened sign The moonlight glanced off the sharp turning spokes of its packer The scream came again unmistakably from the drainage ditch Help meeeee What was that It was the girl In the shadows her eyes were wide and she looked horribly frightened Nothing I said Help meeeee He s alive she whispered Oh God Alive I didn t have to see him I could imagine it all too well Snodgrass lying half in and half out of the drainage ditch back and legs broken carefully-pressed suit caked with mud white gasping face turned up to the indifferent moon I don t hear anything I said Do you She looked at me How can you How Now if you woke him up I said jerking a thumb at the kid he might hear something He might go out there Would you like that Her face began to twitch and pull as if stitched by invisible needles Nothing she whispered Nothing out there She went back to her boy friend and pressed her head against his chest His arms came up around her in his sleep No one else woke up Snodgrass cried and wept and screamed for a long time and then he stopped Dawn Another truck had arrived this one a flatbed with a giant rack for hauling cars It was joined by a bulldozer That scared me The trucker came over and twitched my arm Come on back he whispered excitedly The others were still sleeping Come look at this I followed him back to the supply room About ten trucks were patrolling out there At first I didn t see anything new See he said and pointed Right there Then I saw One of the pickups was stopped dead It was sitting there like a lump all of the menace gone out of it Out of gas That s right buddy And they can t pump their own We got it knocked All we have to do is wait He smiled and fumbled for a cigarette It was about nine o clock and I was eating a piece of yesterday s pie for breakfast when the air horn began long rolling blasts that rattled your skull We went over to the windows and looked out The trucks were sitting still idling One trailer truck a huge Reo with a red cab had pulled up almost to the narrow verge of grass between the restaurant and the parking lot At this distance the square grill was huge and murderous The tires would stand to a man s chest cavity The horn began to blare again hard hungry blasts that traveled off in straight flat lines and echoed back There was a pattern Shorts and longs in some kind of rhythm That s Morse the kid Jerry suddenly exclaimed The trucker looked at him How would you know The kid went a little red I learned it in the Boy Scouts You the trucker said You Wow He shook his head Never mind I said Do you remember enough to Sure Let me listen Got a pencil The counterman gave him one and the kid began to write letters on a napkin After a while he stopped It s just saying Attention over and over again Wait We waited The air horn beat its longs and shorts into the still morning air Then the pattern changed and the kid started to write again We hung over his shoulders and watched the message form Someone must pump fuel Someone will not be harmed All fuel must be pumped This shall be done now Now someone will pump fuel The air blasts kept up but the kid stopped writing It s just repeating Attention again he said The truck repeated its message again and again I didn t like the look of the words printed on the napkin in block style They looked machinelike ruthless There would be no compromise with those words You did or you didn t Well the kid said what do we do Nothing the trucker said His face was excited and working All we have to do is wait They must all be low on fuel One of the little ones out back has already stopped All we have to do The air horn stopped The truck backed up and joined its fellows They waited in a semicircle headlights pointed in toward us There s a bulldozer out there I said Jerry looked at me You think they ll rip the place down Yes He looked at the counterman They couldn t do that could they The counterman shrugged We oughta vote the trucker said No blackmail damn it All we gotta do is wait He had repeated it three times now like a charm Okay I said Vote Wait the trucker said immediately I think we ought to fuel them I said We can wait for a better chance to get away Counterman Stay in here he said You want to be their slaves That s what it ll come to You want to spend the rest of your life changin oil filters every time one of those things blats its horn Not me He looked darkly out the window Let them starve I looked at the kid and the girl I think he s right he said That s the only way to stop them If someone was going to rescue us they would have God knows what s going on in other places And the girl with Snodgrass in her eyes nodded and stepped closer to him That s it then I said I went over to the cigarette machine and got a pack without looking at the brand I d stopped smoking a year ago but this seemed like a good time to start again The smoke rasped harsh in my lungs Twenty minutes crawled by The trucks out front waited In back they were lining up at the pumps I think it was all a bluff the trucker said Just Then there was a louder harsher choppier note the sound of an engine revving up and falling off then revving up again The bulldozer It glittered like a yellowjacket in the sun a Caterpillar with clattering steel treads Black smoke belched from its short stack as it wheeled around to face us It s going to charge the trucker said There was a look of utter surprise on his face It s going to charge Get back I said Behind the counter The bulldozer was still revving Gear-shift levers moved themselves Heat shimmer hung over its smoking stack Suddenly the dozer blade lifted a heavy steel curve clotted with dried dirt Then with a screaming howl of power it roared straight at us The counter I gave the trucker a shove and that started them There was a small concrete verge between the parking lot and the grass The dozer charged over it blade lifting for a moment and then it rammed the front wall head on Glass exploded inward with a heavy coughing roar and the wood frame crashed into splinters One of the overhead light globes fell splashing more glass Crockery fell from the shelves The girl was screaming but the sound was almost lost beneath the steady pounding roar of the Cat s engine It reversed clanked across the chewed strip of lawn and lunged forward again sending the remaining booths crashing and spinning The pie case fell off the counter sending pie wedges skidding across the floor The counterman was crouching with his eyes shut and the kid was holding his girl The trucker was walleyed with fear We gotta stop it he gibbered Tell em we ll do it we ll do anything A little late isn t it The Cat reversed and got ready for another charge New nicks in its blade glittered and heliographed in the sun It lurched forward with a bellowing roar and this time it took down the main support to the left of what had been the window That section of the roof fell in with a grinding crash Plaster dust billowed up The dozer pulled free Beyond it I could see the group of trucks waiting I grabbed the counterman Where are the oil drums The cookstoves ran on butane gas but I had seen vents for a warm-air furnace Back of the storage room he said I grabbed the kid Come on We got up and ran into the storage room The bulldozer hit again and the building trembled Two or three more hits and it would be able to come right up to the counter for a cup of coffee There were two large fifty-gallon drums with feeds to the furnace and turn spigots There was a carton of empty ketchup bottles near the back door Get those Jerry While he did I pulled off my shirt and yanked it to rags The dozer hit again and again and each hit was accompanied by the sound of more breakage I filled four of the ketchup bottles from the spigots and he stuffed rags into them You play football I asked him In high school Okay Pretend you re going in from the five We went out into the restaurant The whole front wall was open to the sky Sprays of glass glittered like diamonds One heavy beam had fallen diagonally across the opening The dozer was backing up to take it out and I thought that this time it would keep coming ripping through the stools and then demolishing the counter itself We knelt down and thrust the bottles out Light them up I said to the trucker He got his matches out but his hands were shaking too badly and he dropped them The counterman picked them up struck one and the hunks of shirt blazed greasily alight Quick I said We ran the kid a little in the lead Glass crunched and gritted underfoot There was a hot oily smell in the air Everything was very loud very bright The dozer charged The kid dodged out under the beam and stood silhouetted in front of that heavy tempered steel blade I went out to the right The kid s first throw fell short His second hit the blade and the flame splashed harmlessly He tried to turn and then it was on him a rolling juggernaut four tons of steel His hands flew up and then he was gone chewed under I buttonhooked around and lobbed one bottle into the open cab and the second right into the works They exploded together in a leaping shout of flame For a moment the dozer s engine rose in an almost human squeal of rage and pain It wheeled in a maddened half-circle ripping out the left corner of the diner and rolled drunkenly toward the drainage ditch The steel treads were streaked and dotted with gore and where the kid had been there was something that looked like a crumpled towel The dozer got almost to the ditch flames boiling from under its cowling and from the cockpit and then it exploded in a geyser I stumbled backward and almost fell over a pile of rubble There was a hot smell that wasn t just oil It was burning hair I was on fire I grabbed a tablecloth jammed it on my head ran behind the counter and plunged my head into the sink hard enough to crack it on the bottom The girl was screaming Jerry s name over and over in a shrieking insane litany I turned around and saw the huge car-carrier slowly rolling toward the defenseless front of the diner The trucker screamed and broke for the side door Don t the counterman cried Don t do that But he was out and sprinting for the drainage ditch and the open field beyond The truck must have been standing sentry just out of sight of that side door a small panel job with Wong s Cash-and-Carry Laundry written on the side It ran him down almost before you could see it happen Then it was gone and only the trucker was left twisted into the gravel He had been knocked out of his shoes The car-carrier rolled slowly over the concrete verge onto the grass over the kid s remains and stopped with its huge snout poking into the diner Its air horn let out a sudden shattering honk followed by another and another Stop the girl whimpered Stop oh stop please But the honks went on a long time It took only a minute to pick up the pattern It was the same as before It wanted someone to feed it and the others I ll go I said Are the pumps unlocked The counterman nodded He had aged fifty years No the girl screamed She threw herself at me You ve got to stop them Beat them burn them break them Her voice wavered and broke into a harsh bray of grief and loss The counterman held her I went around the corner of the counter picking my way through the rubble and out through the supply room My heart was thudding heavily when I stepped out into the warm sun I wanted another cigarette but you don t smoke around fuel islands The trucks were still lined up The laundry truck was crouched across the gravel from me like a hound dog growling and rasping A funny move and it would cream me The sun glittered on its blank windshield and I shuddered It was like looking into the face of an idiot I switched the pump to on and pulled out the nozzle unscrewed the first gas cap and began to pump fuel It took me half an hour to pump the first tank dry and then I moved on to the second island I was alternating between gas and diesel Trucks marched by endlessly I was beginning to understand now I was beginning to see People were doing this all over the country or they were lying dead like the trucker knocked out of their boots with heavy treadmarks mashed across their guts The second tank was dry then and I went to the third The sun was like a hammer and my head was starting to ache with the fumes There were blisters in the soft webbing between thumb and index finger But they wouldn t know about that They would know about leaky manifolds and bad gaskets and frozen universal joints but not about blisters or sunstroke or the need to scream They needed to know only one thing about their late masters and they knew it We bleed The last tank was sucked dry and I threw the nozzle on the ground Still there were more trucks lined up around the corner I twisted my head to relieve a crick in my neck and stared The line went out of the front parking lot and up the road and out of sight two and three lanes deep It was like a nightmare of the Los Angeles Freeway at rush hour The horizon shimmered and danced with their exhaust the air stank of carburization No I said Out of gas All gone fellas And there was a heavier rumble a bass note that shook the teeth A huge silvery truck was pulling up a tanker Written on the side was Fill Up with Phillips The Jetport Fuel A heavy hose dropped out of the rear I went over took it flipped up the feeder plate on the first tank and attached the hose The truck began to pump The stench of petroleum sank into me the same stink that the dinosaurs must have died smelling as they went down into the tar pits I filled the other two tanks and then went back to work Consciousness twinkled away to a point where I lost track of time and trucks I unscrewed rammed the nozzle into the hole pumped until the hot heavy liquid splurted out then replaced the cap My blisters broke trickling pus down to my wrists My head was pounding like a rotted tooth and my stomach rolled helplessly with the stench of hydrocarbons I was going to faint I was going to faint and that would be the end of it I would pump until I dropped Then there were hands on my shoulders the dark hands of the counterman Go in he said Rest yourself I ll take over till dark Try to sleep I handed him the pump But I can t sleep The girl is sleeping She s sprawled over in the corner with her head on a tablecloth and her face won t unknot itself even in sleep It s the timeless ageless face of the warhag I m going to get her up pretty quick It s twilight and the counterman has been out there for five hours Still they keep coming I look out through the wrecked window and their headlights stretch for a mile or better twinkling like yellow sapphires in the growing darkness They must be backed up all the way to the turnpike maybe further The girl will have to take her turn I can show her how She ll say she can t but she will She wants to live You want to be their slaves the counterman had said That s what it ll come to You want to spend the rest of your life changin oil filters every time one of those things blats its horn We could run maybe It would be easy to make the drainage ditch now the way they re stacked up Run through the fields through the marshy places where trucks would bog down like mastodons and go back to the caves Drawing pictures in charcoal This is the moon god This is a tree This is a Mack semi overwhelming a hunter Not even that So much of the world is paved now Even the playgrounds are paved And for the fields and marshes and deep woods there are tanks half-tracks flatbeds equipped with lasers masers heat-seeking radar And little by little they can make it into the world they want I can see great convoys of trucks filling the Okefenokee Swamp with sand the bulldozers ripping through the national parks and wildlands grading the earth flat stamping it into one great flat plain And then the hot-top tmcks arriving But they re machines No matter what s happened to them what mass consciousness we ve given them they can t reproduce In fifty or sixty years they ll be rusting hulks with all menace gone out of them moveless carcasses for free men to stone and spit at And if I close my eyes I can see the production lines in Detroit and Dearborn and Youngstown and Mackinac new trucks being put together by blue-collars who no longer even punch a clock but only drop and are replaced The counterman is staggering a little now He s an old bastard too I ve got to wake the girl Two planes are leaving silver contrails etched across the darkening eastern horizon I wish I could believe there are people in them SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK Jim Norman s wife had been waiting for him since two and when she saw the car pull up in front of their apartment building she came out to meet him She had gone to the store and bought a celebration meal a couple of steaks a bottle of Lancer s a head of lettuce and Thousand Island dressing Now watching him get out of the car she found herself hoping with some desperation and not for the first time that day that there was going to be something to celebrate He came up the walk holding his new briefcase in one hand and four texts in the other She could see the title of the top one Introduction to Grammar She put her hands on his shoulder and asked How did it go And he smiled But that night he had the old dream for the first time in a very long time and woke up sweating with a scream behind his lips His interview had been conducted by the principal of Harold Davis High School and the head of the English Department The subject of his breakdown had come up He had expected it would The principal a bald and cadaverous man named Fenton had leaned back and looked at the ceiling Simmons the English head lit his pipe I was under a great deal of pressure at the time Jim Norman said His fingers wanted to twist about in his lap but he wouldn t let them I think we understand that Fenton said smiling And while we have no desire to pry I m sure we d all agree that teaching is a pressure occupation especially at the high- school level You re onstage five periods out of seven and you re playing to the toughest audience in the world That s why he finished with some pride teachers have more ulcers than any other professional group with the exception of air-traffic controllers Jim said The pressures involved in my breakdown were extreme Fenton and Simmons nodded noncommittal encouragement and Simmons clicked his lighter open to rekindle his pipe Suddenly the office seemed very tight very close Jim had the queer sensation that someone had just turned on a heat lamp over the back of his neck His fingers were twisting in his lap and he made them stop I was in my senior year and practice teaching My mother had died the summer before cancer and in my last conversation with her she asked me to go right on and finish My brother my older brother died when we were both quite young He had been planning to teach and she thought He could see from their eyes that he was wandering and thought God I m making a botch of this I did as she asked he said leaving the tangled relationship of his mother and his brother Wayne poor murdered Wayne and himself behind During the second week of my intern teaching my fiancee was involved in a hit-and-run accident She was the hit part of it Some kid in a hot rod they never caught him Simmons made a soft noise of encouragement I went on There didn t seem to be any other course She was in a great deal of pain a badly broken leg and four fractured ribs but no danger I don t think I really knew the pressure I was under Careful now This is where the ground slopes away I interned at Center Street Vocational Trades High Jim said Garden spot of the city Fenton said Switchblades motor-cycle boots zip guns in the lockers lunch-money protection rackets and every third kid selling dope to the other two I know about Trades There was a kid named Mack Zimmerman Jim said Sensitive boy Played the guitar I had him in a composition class and he had talent I came in one morning and two boys were holding him while a third smashed his Yamaha guitar against the radiator Zimmerman was screaming I yelled for them to stop and give me the guitar I started for them and someone slugged me Jim shrugged That was it I had a breakdown No screaming meemies or crouching in the corner I just couldn t go back When I got near Trades my chest would tighten up I couldn t breathe right I got cold sweat That happens to me too Fenton said amiably I went into analysis A community therapy deal I couldn t afford a psychiatrist It did me good Sally and I are married She has a slight limp and a scar but otherwise good as new He looked at them squarely I guess you could say the same for me Fenton said You actually finished your practice teaching requirement at Cortez High School I believe That s no bed of roses either Simmons said I wanted a hard school Jim said I swapped with another guy to get Cortez A s from your supervisor and critic teacher Fenton commented Yes And a four-year average of Damn close to straight A s I enjoyed my college work Fenton and Simmons glanced at each other then stood up Jim got up We ll be in touch Mr Norman Fenton said We do have a few more applicants to interview Yes of course but speaking for myself I m impressed by your academic records and personal candor It s nice of you to say so Sim perhaps Mr Norman would like a coffee before he goes They shook hands In the hall Simmons said I think you ve got the job if you want it That s off the record of course Jim nodded He had left a lot off the record himself Davis High was a forbidding rockpile that housed a remarkably modern plant the science wing alone had been funded at million in last year s budget The classrooms which still held the ghosts of the WPA workers who had built them and the postwar kids who had first used them were furnished with modern desks and soft-glare blackboards The students were clean well dressed vivacious affluent Six out of ten seniors owned their own cars All in all a good school A fine school to teach in during the Sickie Seventies It made Center Street Vocational Trades look like darkest Africa But after the kids were gone something old and brooding seemed to settle over the halls and whisper in the empty rooms Some black noxious beast never quite in view Sometimes as he walked down the Wing corridor toward the parking lot with his new briefcase in one hand Jim Norman thought he could almost hear it breathing He had the dream again near the end of October and that time he did scream He clawed his way into waking reality to find Sally sitting up in bed beside him holding his shoulder His heart was thudding heavily God he said and scrubbed a hand across his face Are you all right Sure I yelled didn t I Boy did you Nightmare Yes Something from when those boys broke that fellow s guitar No he said Much older than that Sometimes it comes back that s all No sweat Are you sure Yes Do you want a glass of milk Her eyes were dark with concern He kissed her shoulder No Go to sleep She turned off the light and he lay there looking into the darkness He had a good schedule for the new teacher on the staff Period one was free Two and three were freshman comp one group dull one kind of fun Period four was his best class American Lit with college-bound seniors who got a kick out of bashing the ole masters around for a period each day Period five was a consultation period when he was supposed to see students with personal or academic problems There were very few who seemed to have either or who wanted to discuss them with him and he spent most of those periods with a good novel Period six was a grammar course dry as chalkdust Period seven was his only cross The class was called Living with Literature and it was held in a small box of a classroom on the third floor The room was hot in the early fall and cold as the winter approached The class itself was an elective for what school catalogues coyly call the slow learner There were twenty-seven slow learners in Jim s class most of them school jocks The kindest thing you could accuse them of would be disinterest and some of them had a streak of outright malevolence He walked in one day to find an obscene and cruelly accurate caricature of himself on the board with Mr Norman unnecessarily chalked under it He wiped it off without comment and proceeded with the lesson in spite of the snickers He worked up interesting lesson plans included a v materials and ordered several high- interest high-comprehension texts all to no avail The classroom mood veered between unruly hilarity and sullen silence Early in November a fight broke out between two boys during a discussion of Of Mice and Men Jim broke it up and sent both boys to the office When he opened his book to where he had left off the words Bite It glared up at him He took the problem to Simmons who shrugged and lit his pipe I don t have any real solution Jim Last period is always a bitch And for some of them a D grade in your class means no more football or basketball And they ve had the other gut English courses so they re stuck with it And me too Jim said glumly Simmons nodded Show them you mean business and they ll buckle down if only to keep their sports eligibility But period seven remained a constant thorn in his side One of the biggest problems in Living with Lit was a huge slow-moving moose named Chip Osway In early December during the brief hiatus between football and basketball Osway played both Jim caught him with a crib sheet and ran him out of the classroom If you flunk me we ll get you you son of a bitch Osway yelled down the dim third- floor corridor You hear me Go on Jim said Don t waste your breath We ll get you creepo Jim went back into the classroom They looked up at him blandly faces betraying nothing He felt a surge of unreality like the feeling that had washed over him before before Well get you creepo He took his grade book out of his desk opened it to the page titled Living with Literature and carefully lettered an F in the exam slot next to Chip Osway s name That night he had the dream again The dream was always cruelly slow There was time to see and feel everything And there was the added horror of reliving events that were moving toward a known conclusion as helpless as a man strapped into a car going over a cliff In the dream he was nine and his brother Wayne was twelve They were going down Broad Street in Stratford Connecticut bound for the Stratford Library Jim s books were two days overdue and he had hooked four cents from the cupboard bowl to pay the fine It was summer vacation You could smell the freshly cut grass You could hear a ballgame floating out of some second-floor apartment window Yankees leading the Red Sox six to nothing in the top of the eighth Ted Williams batting and you could see the shadows from the Burrets Building Company slowly lengthening across the street as the evening turned slowly toward dark Beyond Teddy s Market and Burrets there was a railroad overpass and on the other side a number of the local losers hung around a closed gas station five or six boys in leather jackets and pegged jeans Jim hated to go by them They yelled out hey four-eyes and hey shit-heels and hey you got an extra quarter and once they chased them half a block But Wayne would not take the long way around That would be chicken In the dream the overpass loomed closer and closer and you began to feel dread struggling in your throat like a big black bird You saw everything the Burrets neon sign just starting to stutter on and off the flakes of rust on the green overpass the glitter of broken glass in the cinders of the railroad bed a broken bike rim in the gutter You try to tell Wayne you ve been through this before a hundred times The local losers aren t hanging around the gas station this time they re hidden in the shadows under the trestle But it won t come out You re helpless Then you re underneath and some of the shadows detach themselves from the walls and a tall kid with a blond crew cut and a broken nose pushes Wayne up against the sooty cinderblocks and says Give us some money Let me alone You try to run but a fat guy with greasy black hair grabs you and throws you against the wall next to your brother His left eyelid is jittering up and down nervously and he says Come on kid how much you got F-four cents You fuckin liar Wayne tries to twist free and a guy with odd orange-colored hair helps the blond one to hold him The guy with the jittery eyelid suddenly bashes you one in the mouth You feel a sudden heaviness in your groin and a dark patch appears on your jeans Look Vmnie he wet himself Wayne s struggles become frenzied and he almost not quite gets free Another guy wearing black chinos and a white T-shirt throws him back There is a small strawberry birthmark on his chin The stone throat of the overpass is beginning to tremble The metal girders pick up a thrumming vibration Train coming Someone strikes the books out of your hands and the kid with the birthmark on his chin kicks them into the gutter Wayne suddenly kicks out with his right foot and it connects with the crotch of the kid with the jittery face He screams Vmnie he s gettin away The kid with the jittery face is screaming about his nuts but even his howls are lost in the gathering shaking roar of the approaching train Then it is over them and its noise fills the world Light flashes on switchblades The kid with the blond crew cut is holding one and Birthmark has the other You can t hear Wayne but his words are in the shape of his lips Run Jimmy run You slip to your knees and the hands holding you are gone and you skitter between a pair of legs like a frog A hand slaps down on your back groping for purchase and gets none Then you are running back the way you came with all of the horrible sludgy slowness of dreams You look back over your shoulder and see He woke in the dark Sally sleeping peacefully beside him He bit back the scream and when it was throttled he fell back When he had looked back back into the yawning darkness of the overpass he had seen the blond kid and the birth-marked kid drive their knives into his brother Blondie s below the breastbone and Birthmark s directly into his brother s groin He lay in the darkness breathing harshly waiting for that nine-year-old ghost to depart waiting for honest sleep to blot it all away An unknown time later it did The Christmas vacation and semester break were combined in the city s school district and the holiday was almost a month long The dream came twice early on and did not come again He and Sally went to visit her sister in Vermont and skied a great deal They were happy Jim s Living with Lit problem seemed inconsequential and a little foolish in the open crystal air He went back to school with a winter tan feeling cool and collected Simmons caught him on the way to his period-two class and handed him a folder New student period seven Name is Robert Lawson Transfer Hey I ve got twenty-seven in there right now Sim I m overloaded You ve still got twenty-seven Bill Stearns got killed the Tuesday after Christmas Car accident Hit-and-run Billy The picture formed in his mind in black and white like a senior photograph William Stearns Key Club Football Pen Lance He had been one of the few good ones in Living with Lit Quiet consistent A s and B s on his exams Didn t volunteer often but usually summoned the correct answers laced with a pleasing dry wit when called on Dead Fifteen years old His own mortality suddenly whispered through his bones like a cold draft under a door Christ that s awful Do they know what happened Cops are checking into it He was downtown exchanging a Christmas present Started across Rampart Street and an old Ford sedan hit him No one got the license number but the words Snake Eyes were written on the side door the way a kid would do it Christ Jim said again There s the bell Simmons said He hurried away pausing to break up a crowd of kids around a drinking fountain Jim went toward his class feeling empty During his free period he flipped open Robert Lawson s folder The first page was a green sheet from Milford High which Jim had never heard of The second was a student personality profile Adjusted IQ of Some manual skills not many Antisocial answers to the Barnett-Hudson personality test Poor aptitude scores Jim thought sourly that he was a Living with Lit kid all the way The next page was a disciplinary history the yellow sheet The Milford sheet was white with a black border and it was depressingly well filled Lawson had been in a hundred kinds of trouble He turned the next page glanced down at a school photo of Robert Lawson then looked again Terror suddenly crept into the pit of his belly and coiled there warm and hissing Lawson was staring antagonistically into the camera as if posing for a police mug shot rather than a school photographer There was a small strawberry birthmark on his chin By period seven he had brought all the civilized rationalizations into play He told himself there must be thousands of kids with red birthmarks on their chins He told himself that the hood who had stabbed his brother that day sixteen long dead years ago would now be at least thirty-two But climbing to the third floor the apprehension remained And another fear to go with it This is how you felt when you were cracking up He tasted the bright steel of panic in his mouth The usual group of kids was horsing around the door of Room and some of them went in when they saw Jim coming A few hung around talking in undertones and grinning He saw the new boy standing beside Chip Osway Robert Lawson was wearing blue jeans and heavy yellow tractor boots all the rage this year Chip go on in That an order He smiled vacuously over Jim s head Sure You flunk me on that test Sure Yeah that s The rest was an under-the-breath mumble Jim turned to Robert Lawson You re new he said I just wanted to tell you how we mn things around here Sure Mr Norman His right eyebrow was split with a small scar a scar Jim knew There could be no mistake It was crazy it was lunacy but it was also a fact Sixteen years ago this kid had driven a knife into his brother Numbly as if from a great distance he heard himself beginning to outline the class mles and regulations Robert Lawson hooked his thumbs into his garrison belt listened smiled and began to nod as if they were old friends Jim Hmmm Is something wrong No Those Living with Lit boys still giving you a hard time No answer Jim No Why don t you go to bed early tonight But he didn t The dream was very bad that night When the kid with the strawberry birthmark stabbed his brother with his knife he called after Jim You next kid Right through the bag He woke up screaming He was teaching Lord of the Flies that week and talking about symbolism when Lawson raised his hand Robert he said evenly Why do you keep starin at me Jim blinked and felt his mouth go dry You see somethin green Or is my fly unzipped A nervous titter from the class Jim replied evenly I wasn t staring at you Mr Lawson Can you tell us why Ralph and Jack disagreed over You were starin at me Do you want to talk about it with Mr Fenton Lawson appeared to think it over Naw Good Now can you tell us why Ralph and Jack I didn t read it I think it s a dumb book Jim smiled tightly Do you now You want to remember that while you re judging the book the book is also judging you Now can anyone else tell me why they disagreed over the existence of the beast Kathy Slavin raised her hand timidly and Lawson gave her a cynical once-over and said something to Chip Osway The words leaving his lips looked like nice tits Chip nodded Kathy Isn t it because Jack wanted to hunt the beast Good He turned and began to write on the board At the instant his back was turned a grapefruit smashed against the board beside his head He jerked backward and wheeled around Some class members laughed but Osway and Lawson only looked at Jim innocently Jim stooped and picked up the grapefruit Someone he said looking toward the back of the room ought to have this jammed down his goddamn throat Kathy Slavin gasped He tossed the grapefruit in the wastebasket and turned back to the blackboard He opened the morning paper sipping his coffee and saw the headline about halfway down God he said splitting his wife s easy flow of morning chatter His belly felt suddenly filled with splinters Teen-Age Girl Falls to Her Death Katherine Slavin a seventeen-year-old junior at Harold Davis High School either fell or was pushed from the roof of her downtown apartment house early yesterday evening The girl who kept a pigeon coop on the roof had gone up with a sack of feed according to her mother Police said an unidentified woman in a neighboring development had seen three young boys running across the roof at p m just minutes after the girl s body continued page Jim was she one of yours But he could only look at her mutely Two weeks later Simmons met him in the hall after the lunch bell with a folder in his hand and Jim felt a terrible sinking in his belly New student he said flatly to Simmons Living with Lit Sim s eyebrows went up How did you know that Jim shrugged and held his hand out for the folder Got to run Simmons said Department heads are meeting on course evaluations You look a little run-down Feeling okay That s right a little run-down Like Billy Stearns Sure he said That s the stuff Simmons said and clapped him on the back When he was gone Jim opened the folder to the picture wincing in advance like a man about to be hit But the face wasn t instantly familiar Just a kid s face Maybe he d seen it before maybe not The kid David Garcia was a hulking dark-haired boy with rather negroid lips and dark slumbering eyes The yellow sheet said he was also from Mil-ford High and that he had spent two years in Granville Reformatory Car theft Jim closed the folder with hands that trembled slightly Sally She looked up from her ironing He had been staring at a TV basketball game without really seeing it Nothing he said Forgot what I was going to say Must have been a lie He smiled mechanically and looked at the TV again It had been on the tip of his tongue to spill everything But how could he It was worse than crazy Where would you start The dream The breakdown The appearance of Robert Lawson No With Wayne your brother But he had never told anyone about that not even in analysis His thoughts turned to David Garcia and the dreamy terror that had washed over him when they had looked at each other in the hall Of course he had only looked vaguely familiar in the picture Pictures don t move or twitch Garcia had been standing with Lawson and Chip Osway and when he looked up and saw Jim Norman he smiled and his eyelids began to jitter up and down and voices spoke in Jim s mind with unearthly clarity Come on kid how much you got F-four cents You fuckin liar look Vmnie he wet himself Jim Did you say something No But he wasn t sure if he had or not He was getting very scared One day after school in early February there was a knock on the teachers room door and when Jim opened it Chip Osway stood there He looked frightened Jim was alone it was ten after four and the last of the teachers had gone home an hour before He was correcting a batch of American Lit themes Chip he said evenly Chip shuffled his feet Can I talk to you for a minute Mr Norman Sure But if it s about that test you re wasting your It s not about that Uh can I smoke in here Go ahead He lit his cigarette with a hand that trembled slightly He didn t speak for perhaps as long as a minute It seemed that he couldn t His lips twitched his hands came together and his eyes slitted as if some inner self was struggling to find expression He suddenly burst out If they do it I want you to know I wasn t in on it I don t like those guys They re creeps What guys Chip Lawson and that Garcia creep Are they planning to get me The old dreamy terror was on him and he knew the answer I liked them at first Chip said We went out and had a few beers I started bitchin about you and that test About how I was gonna get you But that was just talk I swear it What happened They took me right up on it Asked what time you left school what kind of car you drove all that stuff I said what have you got against him and Garcia said they knew you a long time ago hey are you all right The cigarette he said thickly Haven t ever gotten used to the smoke Chip ground it out I asked them when they knew you and Bob Lawson said I was still pissin my didies then But they re seventeen the same as me Then what Well Garcia leans over the table and says you can t want to get him very bad if you don t even know when he leaves the fuckin school What was you gonna do So I says I was gonna matchstick your tires and leave you with four flats He looked at Jim with pleading eyes I wasn t even gonna do that I said it because You were scared Jim asked quietly Yeah and I m still scared What did they think of your idea Chip shuddered Bob Lawson says is that what you was gonna do you cheap prick And I said tryin to be tough what was you gonna do off him And Garcia his eyelids start to go up and down he takes something out of his pocket and clicked it open and it s a switchknife That s when I took off When was this Chip Yesterday I m scared to sit with those guys now Mr Norman Okay Jim said Okay He looked down at the papers he had been correcting without seeing them What are you going to do I don t know Jim said I really don t On Monday morning he still didn t know His first thought had been to tell Sally everything starting with his brother s murder sixteen years ago But it was impossible She would be sympathetic but frightened and unbelieving Simmons Also impossible Simmons would think he was mad And maybe he was A man in a group encounter session he had attended had said having a breakdown was like breaking a vase and then gluing it back together You could never tmst yourself to handle that vase again with any surety You couldn t put a flower in it because flowers need water and water might dissolve the glue Am I crazy then If he was Chip Osway was too That thought came to him as he was getting into his car and a bolt of excitement went through him Of course Lawson and Garcia had threatened him in Chip Osway s presence That might not stand up in court but it would get the two of them suspended if he could get Chip to repeat his story in Fenton s office And he was almost sure he could get Chip to do that Chip had his own reasons for wanting them far away He was driving into the parking lot when he thought about what had happened to Billy Stearns and Kathy Slavin During his free period he went up to the office and leaned over the registration secretary s desk She was doing the absence list Chip Osway here today he asked casually Chip She looked at him doubtfully Charles Osway Jim amended Chip s a nickname She leafed through a pile of slips glanced at one and pulled it out He s absent Mr Norman Can you get me his phone number She pushed her pencil into her hair and said Certainly She dug it out of the O file and handed it to him Jim dialed the number on an office phone The phone rang a dozen times and he was about to hang up when a rough sleep-blurred voice said Yeah Mr Osway Barry Osway s been dead six years I m Gary Denkinger Are you Chip Osway s stepfather What d he do Pardon He s run off I want to know what he did So far as I know nothing I just wanted to talk with him Do you have any idea where he might be Naw I work nights I don t know none of his friends Any idea at a Nope He took the old suitcase and fifty bucks he saved up from stealin car parts or sellin dope or whatever these kids do for money Gone to San Francisco to be a hippie for all I know If you hear from him will you call me at school Jim Norman English wing Sure will Jim put the phone down The registration secretary looked up and offered a quick meaningless smile Jim didn t smile back Two days later the words left school appeared after Chip Osway s name on the morning attendance slip Jim began to wait for Simmons to show up with a new folder A week later he did He looked dully down at the picture No question about this one The crew cut had been replaced by long hair but it was still blond And the face was the same Vincent Corey Vinnie to his friends and intimates He stared up at Jim from the picture an insolent grin on his lips When he approached his period-seven class his heart was thudding gravely in his chest Lawson and Garcia and Vinnie Corey were standing by the bulletin board outside the door they all straightened when he came toward them Vinnie smiled his insolent smile but his eyes were as cold and dead as ice floes You must be Mr Norman Hi Norm Lawson and Garcia tittered I m Mr Norman Jim said ignoring the hand that Vinnie had put out You ll remember that Sure I ll remember it How s your brother Jim froze He felt his bladder loosen and as if from far away from down a long corridor somewhere in his cranium he heard a ghostly voice Look Vinnie he wet himself What do you know about my brother he asked thickly Nothin Vinnie said Nothin much They smiled at him with their empty dangerous smiles The bell rang and they sauntered inside Drugstore phone booth ten o clock that night Operator I want to call the police station in Stratford Connecticut No I don t know the number Clickings on the line Conferences The policeman had been Mr Nell In those days he had been white-haired perhaps in his mid-fifties Hard to tell when you were just a kid Their father was dead and somehow Mr Nell had known that Call me Mr Nell boys Jim and his brother met at lunchtime every day and they went into the Stratford Diner to eat their bag lunches Mom gave them each a nickel to buy milk that was before school milk programs started And sometimes Mr Nell would come in his leather belt creaking with the weight of his belly and his revolver and buy them each a pie a la mode Where were you when they stabbed my brother Mr Nell A connection was made The phone rang once Stratford Police Hello My name is James Norman Officer I m calling long-distance He named the city I want to know if you can give me a line on a man who would have been on the force around Hold the line a moment Mr Norman A pause then a new voice I m Sergeant Morton Livingston Mr Norman Who are you trying to locate Well Jim said us kids just called him Mr Nell Does that Hell yes Don Nell s retired now He s seventy-three or four Does he still live in Stratford Yes over on Barnum Avenue Would you like the address And the phone number if you have it Okay Did you know Don He used to buy my brother and me apple pie a la mode down at the Stratford Diner Christ that s been gone ten years Wait a minute He came back on the phone and read an address and a phone number Jim jotted them down thanked Livingston and hung up He dialed O again gave the number and waited When the phone began to ring a sudden hot tension filled him and he leaned forward turning instinctively away from the drugstore soda fountain although there was no one there but a plump teen-age girl reading a magazine The phone was picked up and a rich masculine voice sounding not at all old said Hello That single word set off a dusty chain reaction of memories and emotions as startling as the Pavlovian reaction that can be set off by hearing an old record on the radio Mr Nell Donald Nell Yes My name is James Norman Mr Nell Do you remember me by any chance Yes the voice responded immediately Pie a la mode Your brother was killed knifed A shame He was a lovely boy Jim collapsed against one of the booth s glass walls The tension s sudden departure left him as weak as a stuffed toy He found himself on the verge of spilling everything and he bit the urge back desperately Mr Nell those boys were never caught No Nell said We did have suspects As I recall we had a lineup at a Bridgeport police station Were those suspects identified to me by name No The procedure at a police showup was to address the participants by number What s your interest in this now Mr Norman Let me throw some names at you Jim said I want to know if they ring a bell in connection with the case Son I wouldn t You might Jim said beginning to feel a trifle desperate Robert Lawson David Garcia Vincent Corey Do any of those Corey Mr Nell said flatly I remember him Vinnie the Viper Yes we had him up on that His mother alibied him I don t get anything from Robert Lawson That could be anyone s name But Garcia that rings a bell I m not sure why Hell I m old He sounded disgusted Mr Nell is there any way you could check on those boys Well of course they wouldn t be boys anymore Oh yeah Listen Jimmy Has one of those boys popped up and started harassing you I don t know Some strange things have been happening Things connected with the stabbing of my brother What things Mr Nell I can t tell you You d think I was crazy His reply quick firm interested Are you Jim paused No he said Okay I can check the names through Stratford R I Where can I get in touch Jim gave his home number You d be most likely to catch me on Tuesday night He was in almost every night but on Tuesday evenings Sally went to her pottery class What are you doing these days Jimmy Teaching school Good This might take a few days you know I m retired now You sound just the same Ah but if you could see me He chuckled D you still like a good piece of pie a la mode Jimmy Sure Jim said It was a lie He hated pie a la mode I m glad to hear that Well if there s nothing else I ll There is one more thing Is there a Milford High in Stratford Not that I know of That s what I Only thing name of Milford around here is Milford Cemetery out on the Ash Heights Road And no one ever graduated from there He chuckled dryly and to Jim s ears it sounded like the sudden rattle of bones in a pit Thank you he heard himself saying Goodbye Mr Nell was gone The operator asked him to deposit sixty cents and he put it in automatically He turned and stared into a horrid squashed face plastered up against the glass framed in two spread hands the splayed fingers flattened white against the glass as was the tip of the nose It was Vinnie grinning at him Jim screamed Class again Living with Lit was doing a composition and most of them were bent sweatily over their papers putting their thoughts grimly down on the page as if chopping wood All but three Robert Lawson sitting in Billy Stearns s seat David Garcia in Kathy Slavin s Vinnie Corey in Chip Osway s They sat with their blank papers in front of them watching him A moment before the bell Jim said softly I want to talk to you for a minute after class Mr Corey Sure Norm Lawson and Garcia tittered noisily but the rest of the class did not When the bell rang they passed in their papers and fairly bolted through the door Lawson and Garcia lingered and Jim felt his belly tighten Is it going to be now Then Lawson nodded at Vinnie See you later Yeah They left Lawson closed the door and from beyond the frosted glass David Garcia suddenly yelled hoarsely Norm eats it Vinnie looked at the door then back at Jim He smiled He said I was wondering if you d ever get down to it Really Jim said Scared you the other night in the phone both right dad No one says dad anymore Vinnie It s not cool Like cool s not cool It s as dead as Buddy Holly I talk the way I want Vinnie said Where s the other one The guy with the funny red hair Split man But under his studied unconcern Jim sensed a wariness He s alive isn t he That s why he s not here He s alive and he s thirty-two or three the way you would be if Bleach was always a drag He s nothin Vinnie sat up behind his desk and put his hands down flat on the old graffiti His eyes glittered Man I remember you at that lineup You looked ready to piss your little old corduroy pants I seen you lookin at me and Davie I put the hex on you I suppose you did Jim said You gave me sixteen years of bad dreams Wasn t that enough Why now Why me Vinnie looked puzzled and then smiled again Because you re unfinished business man You got to be cleaned up Where were you Jim asked Before Vinnie s lips thinned We ain t talkin about that Dig They dug you a hole didn t they Vinnie Six feet deep Right in the Milford Cemetery Six feet of You shut up He was on his feet The desk fell over in the aisle It s not going to be easy Jim said I m not going to make it easy for you We re gonna kill you dad You ll find out about that hole Get out of here Maybe that little wifey of yours too You goddamn punk if you touch her He started forward blindly feeling violated and terrified by the mention of Sally Vinnie grinned and started for the door Just be cool Cool as a fool He tittered If you touch my wife I ll kill you Vinnie s grin widened Kill me Man I thought you knew I m already dead He left His footfalls echoed in the corridor for a long time What are you reading hon Jim held the binding of the book Raising Demons out for her to read Yuck She turned back to the mirror to check her hair Will you take a taxi home he asked It s only four blocks Besides the walk is good for my figure Someone grabbed one of my girls over on Summer Street he lied She thinks the object was rape Really Who Dianne Snow he said making a name up at random She s a levelheaded girl Treat yourself to a taxi okay Okay she said She stopped at his chair knelt put her hands on his cheeks and looked into his eyes What s the matter Jim Nothing Yes Something is Nothing I can t handle Is it something about your brother A draft of terror blew over him as if an inner door had been opened Why do you say that You were moaning his name in your sleep last night Wayne Wayne you were saying Run Wayne It s nothing But it wasn t They both knew it He watched her go Mr Nell called at quarter past eight You don t have to worry about those guys he said They re all dead Is that so He was holding his place in Raising Demons with his index finger as he talked Car smash Six months after your brother was killed A cop was chasing them Frank Simon was the cop as a matter of fact He works out at Sikorsky now Probably makes a lot more money And they crashed The car left the road at more than a hundred miles an hour and hit a main power pole When they finally got the power shut off and scraped them out they were cooked medium rare Jim closed his eyes You saw the report Looked at it myself Anything on the car It was a hot rod Any description Black Ford sedan with Snake Eyes written on the side Fitting enough They really crapped out They had a sidekick Mr Nell I don t know his name but his nickname was Bleach That would be Charlie Sponder Mr Nell said without hesitation He bleached his hair with Clorox one time I remember that It went streaky-white and he tried to dye it back The streaks went orange Do you know what he s doing now Career army man Joined up in fifty-eight or nine after he got a local girl pregnant Could I get in touch with him His mother lives in Stratford She d know Can you give me her address I won t Jimmy Not until you tell me what s eating you I can t Mr Nell You d think I was crazy Try me I can t All right son Will you But the line was dead You bastard Jim said and put the phone in the cradle It rang under his hand and he jerked away from it as if it had suddenly burned him He looked at it breathing heavily It rang three times four He picked it up Listened Closed his eyes A cop pulled him over on his way to the hospital then went ahead of him siren screaming There was a young doctor with a toothbrush mustache in the emergency room He looked at Jim with dark emotionless eyes Excuse me I m James Norman and I m sorry Mr Norman She died at p m He was going to faint The world went far away and swimmy and there was a high buzzing in his ears His eyes wandered without purpose seeing green tiled walls a wheeled stretcher glittering under the overhead fluorescents a nurse with her cap on crooked Time to freshen up honey An orderly was leaning against the wall outside Emergency Room No Wearing dirty whites with a few drops of drying blood splattered across the front Cleaning his fingernails with a knife The orderly looked up and grinned into Jim s eyes The orderly was David Garcia Jim fainted Funeral Like a dance in three acts The house The funeral parlor The graveyard Faces coming out of nowhere whirling close whirling off into the darkness again Sally s mother her eyes streaming tears behind a black veil Her father looking shocked and old Simmons Others They introduced themselves and shook his hand He nodded not remembering their names Some of the women brought food and one lady brought an apple pie and someone ate a piece and when he went out in the kitchen he saw it sitting on the counter cut wide open and drooling juice into the pie plate like amber blood and he thought Should have a big scoop of vanilla ice cream right on top He felt his hands and legs trembling wanting to go across to the counter and throw the pie against the wall And then they were going and he was watching himself the way you watch yourself in a home movie as he shook hands and nodded and said Thank you Yes I will Thank you I m sure she is Thank you When they were gone the house was his again He went over to the mantel It was cluttered with souvenirs of their marriage A stuffed dog with jeweled eyes that she had won at Coney Island on their honeymoon Two leather folders his diploma from B U and hers from U Mass A giant pair of styrofoam dice she had given him as a gag after he had dropped sixteen dollars in Pinky Silverstein s poker game a year or so before A thin china cup she had bought in a Cleveland junk shop last year In the middle of the mantel their wedding picture He turned it over and then sat down in his chair and looked at the blank TV set An idea began to form behind his eyes An hour later the phone rang jolting him out of a light doze He groped for it You re next Norm Vinnie Man she was like one of those clay pigeons in a shooting gallery Wham and splatter I ll be at the school tonight Vinnie Room I ll leave the lights off It ll be just like the overpass that day I think I can even provide the train Just want to end it all is that right That s right Jim said You be there Maybe You ll be there Jim said and hung up It was almost dark when he got to the school He parked in his usual slot opened the back door with his passkey and went first to the English Department office on the second floor He let himself in opened the record cabinet and began to flip through the records He paused about halfway through the stack and took out one called Hi-Fi Sound Effects He turned it over The third cut on the A side was Freight Train He put the album on top of the department s portable stereo and took Raising Demons out of his overcoat pocket He turned to a marked passage read something and nodded He turned out the lights Room He set up the stereo system stretching the speakers to their widest separation and then put on the freight-train cut The sound came swelling up out of nothing until it filled the whole room with the harsh clash of diesel engines and steel on steel With his eyes closed he could almost believe he was under the Broad Street trestle driven to his knees watching as the savage little drama worked to its inevitable conclusion He opened his eyes rejected the record then reset it He sat behind his desk and opened Raising Demons to a chapter entitled Malefic Spirits and How to Call Them His lips moved as he read and he paused at intervals to take objects out of his pocket and lay them on his desk First an old and creased Kodak of him and his brother standing on the lawn in front of the Broad Street apartment house where they had lived They both had identical crew cuts and both of them were smiling shyly into the camera Second a small bottle of blood He had caught a stray alley cat and slit its throat with his pocketknife Third the pocketknife itself Last a sweatband ripped from the lining of an old Little League baseball cap Wayne s cap Jim had kept it in secret hopes that someday he and Sally would have a son to wear it He got up went to the window looked out The parking lot was empty He began to push the school desks toward the walls leaving a rough circle in the middle of the room When that was done he got chalk from his desk drawer and following the diagram in the book exactly and using a yardstick he drew a pentagram on the floor His breath was coming harder now He turned off the lights gathered his objects in one hand and began to recite Dark Father hear me for my soul s sake I am one who promises sacrifice I am one who begs a dark boon for sacrifice I am one who seeks vengeance of the left hand I bring blood in promise of sacrifice He screwed the cap off the jar which had originally held peanut butter and splashed it within the pentagram Something happened in the darkened schoolroom It was not possible to say exactly what but the air became heavier There was a thickness in it that seemed to fill the throat and the belly with gray steel The deep silence grew swelled with something unseen He did as the old rites instructed Now there was a feeling in the air that reminded Jim of the time he had taken a class to visit a huge power station a feeling that the very air was crammed with electric potential and was vibrating And then a voice curiously low and unpleasant spoke to him What do you require He could not tell if he was actually hearing it or only thinking that he did He spoke two sentences It is a small boon What do you offer Jim spoke two words Both the voice whispered Right and left Agreed Yes Then give me what is mine He opened his pocketknife turned to his desk laid his right hand down flat and hacked off his right index finger with four hard chops Blood flew across the blotter in dark patterns It didn t hurt at all He brushed the finger aside and switched the pocketknife to his right hand Cutting off the left finger was harder His right hand felt awkward and alien with the missing finger and the knife kept slipping At last with an impatient grunt he threw the knife away snapped the bone and ripped the finger free He picked them both up like breadsticks and threw them into the pentagram There was a bright flash of light like an old-fashioned photographer s flashpowder No smoke he noted No smell of brimstone What objects have you brought A photograph A band of cloth that has been dipped in his sweat Sweat is precious the voice remarked and there was a cold greed in the tone that made Jim shiver Give them to me Jim threw them into the pentagram The light flashed It is good the voice said If they come Jim said There was no response The voice was gone if it had ever been there He leaned closer to the pentagram The picture was still there but blackened and charred The sweatband was gone In the street there was a noise faint at first then swelling A hot rod equipped with glasspack mufflers first turning onto Davis Street then approaching Jim sat down listening to hear if it would go by or turn in It turned in Footfalls on the stairs echoing Robert Lawson s high-pitched giggle then someone going Shhhhh and then Lawson s giggle again The footfalls came closer lost their echo and then the glass door at the head of the stairs banged open Yoo-hoo Normie David Garcia called falsetto You there Normie Lawson whispered and then giggled Vas you dere Cholly Vinnie didn t speak but as they advanced up the hall Jim could see their shadows Vinnie s was the tallest and he was holding a long object in one hand There was a light snick of sound and the long object became longer still They were standing by the door Vinnie in the middle They were all holding knives Here we come man Vinnie said softly Here we come for your ass Jim turned on the record player Jesus Garcia called out jumping What s that The freight train was coming closer You could almost feel the walls thrumming with it The sound no longer seemed to be coming out of the speakers but from down the hall from down tracks someplace far away in time as well as space I don t like this man Lawson said It s too late Vinnie said He stepped forward and gestured with the knife Give us your money dad let us go Garcia recoiled What the hell But Vinnie never hesitated He motioned the others to spread out and the thing in his eyes might have been relief Come on kid how much you got Garcia asked suddenly Four cents Jim said It was true He had picked them out of the penny jar in the bedroom The most recent date was You fuckin liar leave him alone Lawson glanced over his shoulder and his eyes widened The walls had become misty insubstantial The freight train wailed The light from the parking-lot streetlamp had reddened like the neon Burrets Building Company sign stuttering against the twilight sky Something was walking out of the pentagram something with the face of a small boy perhaps twelve years old A boy with a crew cut Garcia darted forward and punched Jim in the mouth He could smell mixed garlic and pepperoni on his breath It was all slow and painless Jim felt a sudden heaviness like lead in his groin and his bladder let go He looked down and saw a dark patch appear and spread on his pants Look Vinnie he wet himself Lawson cried out The tone was right but the expression on his face was one of horror the expression of a puppet that has come to life only to find itself on strings Let him alone the Wayne-thing said but it was not Wayne s voice it was the cold greedy voice of the thing from the pentagram Run Jimmy Run Run Run Jim slipped to his knees and a hand slapped down on his back groping for purchase and found none He looked up and saw Vinnie his face stretched into a caricature of hatred drive his knife into the Wayne-thing just below the breastbone and then scream his face collapsing in on itself charring blackening becoming awful Then he was gone Garcia and Lawson struck a moment later writhed charred and disappeared Jim lay on the floor breathing harshly The sound of the freight train faded His brother was looking down at him Wayne he breathed And the face changed It seemed to melt and run together The eyes went yellow and a horrible grinning malignancy looked out at him I ll come back Jim the cold voice whispered And it was gone He got up slowly and turned off the record player with one mangled hand He touched his mouth It was bleeding from Garcia s punch He went over and turned on the lights The room was empty He looked out into the parking lot and that was empty too except for one hubcap that reflected the moon in idiot pantomime The classroom air smelled old and stale the atmosphere of tombs He erased the pentagram on the floor and then began to straighten up the desks for the substitute the next day His fingers hurt very badly what fingers He would have to see a doctor He closed the door and went downstairs slowly holding his hands to his chest Halfway down something a shadow or perhaps only an intuition made him whirl around Something unseen seemed to leap back Jim remembered the warning in Raising Demons the danger involved You could perhaps summon them perhaps cause them to do your work You could even get rid of them But sometimes they come back He walked down the stairs again wondering if the nightmare was over after all STRAWBERRY SPRING Springheel Jack I saw those two words in the paper this morning and my God how they take me back All that was eight years ago almost to the day Once while it was going on I saw myself on nationwide TV the Walter Cronkite Report Just a hurrying face in the general background behind the reporter but my folks picked me out right away They called long distance My dad wanted my analysis of the situation he was all bluff and hearty and man-to-man My mother just wanted me to come home But I didn t want to come home I was enchanted Enchanted by that dark and mist-blown strawberry spring and by the shadow of violent death that walked through it on those nights eight years ago The shadow of Springheel Jack In New England they call it a strawberry spring No one knows why it s just a phrase the old-timers use They say it happens once every eight or ten years What happened at New Sharon Teachers College that particular strawberry spring there may be a cycle for that too but if anyone has figured it out they ve never said At New Sharon the strawberry spring began on March The coldest winter in twenty years broke on that day It rained and you could smell the sea twenty miles west of the beaches The snow which had been thirty-five inches deep in places began to melt and the campus walks ran with slush The Winter Carnival snow sculptures which had been kept sharp and clearcut for two months by the subzero temperatures at last began to sag and slouch The caricature of Lyndon Johnson in front of the Tep fraternity house cried melted tears The dove in front of Prashner Hall lost its frozen feathers and its plywood skeleton showed sadly through in places And when night came the fog came with it moving silent and white along the narrow college avenues and thoroughfares The pines on the mall poked through it like counting fingers and it drifted slow as cigarette smoke under the little bridge down by the Civil War cannons It made things seem out of joint strange magical The unwary traveler would step out of the juke-thumping brightly lit confusion of the Grinder expecting the hard clear starriness of winter to clutch him and instead he would suddenly find himself in a silent muffled world of white drifting fog the only sound his own footsteps and the soft drip of water from the ancient gutters You half expected to see Gollum or Frodo and Sam go hurrying past or to turn and see that the Grinder was gone vanished replaced by a foggy panorama of moors and yew trees and perhaps a Druid-circle or a sparkling fairy ring The jukebox played Love Is Blue that year It played Hey Jude endlessly endlessly It played Scarborough Fair And at ten minutes after eleven on that night a junior named John Dancey on his way back to his dormitory began screaming into the fog dropping books on and between the sprawled legs of the dead girl lying in a shadowy corner of the Animal Sciences parking lot her throat cut from ear to ear but her eyes open and almost seeming to sparkle as if she had just successfully pulled off the funniest joke of her young life Dancey an education major and a speech minor screamed and screamed and screamed The next day was overcast and sullen and we went to classes with questions eager in our mouths who why when do you think theyTl get him And always the final thrilled question Did you know her Did you know her Yes I had an art class with her Yes one of my roommate s friends dated her last term Yes she asked me for a light once in the Grinder She was at the next table Yes Yes I Yes yes oh yes I We all knew her Her name was Gale Cerman pronounced Kerr-man and she was an art major She wore granny glasses and had a good figure She was well liked but her roommates had hated her She had never gone out much even though she was one of the most promiscuous girls on campus She was ugly but cute She had been a vivacious girl who talked little and smiled seldom She had been pregnant and she had had leukemia She was a lesbian who had been murdered by her boyfriend It was strawberry spring and on the morning of March we all knew Gale Cerman Half a dozen State Police cars crawled onto the campus most of them parked in front of Judith Franklin Hall where the Cerman girl had lived On my way past there to my ten o clock class I was asked to show my student ID I was clever I showed him the one without the fangs Do you carry a knife the policeman asked cunningly Is it about Gale Cerman I asked after I told him that the most lethal thing on my person was a rabbit s-foot key chain What makes you ask He pounced I was five minutes late to class It was strawberry spring and no one walked by themselves through the half-academical half-fantastical campus that night The fog had come again smelling of the sea quiet and deep Around nine o clock my roommate burst into our rom where I had been busting my brains on a Milton essay since seven They caught him he said I heard it over at the Grinder From who I don t know Some guy Her boyfriend did it His name is Carl Amalara I settled back relieved and disappointed With a name like that it had to be true A lethal and sordid little crime of passion Okay I said That s good He left the room to spread the news down the hall I reread my Milton essay couldn t figure out what I had been trying to say tore it up and started again It was in the papers the next day There was an incongruously neat picture of Amalara probably a high-school graduation picture and it showed a rather sad-looking boy with an olive complexion and dark eyes and pockmarks on his nose The boy had not confessed yet but the evidence against him was strong He and Gale Cerman had argued a great deal in the last month or so and had broken up the week before Amalara s roomie said he had been despondent In a foot-locker under his bed police had found a seven-inch hunting knife from L L Bean s and a picture of the girl that had apparently been cut up with a pair of shears Beside Amalara s picture was one of Gale Cerman It blurrily showed a dog a peeling lawn flamingo and a rather mousy blond girl wearing spectacles An uncomfortable smile had turned her lips up and her eyes were squinted One hand was on the dog s head It was true then It had to be true The fog came again that night not on little cat s feet but in an improper silent sprawl I walked that night I had a headache and I walked for air smelling the wet misty smell of the spring that was slowly wiping away the reluctant snow leaving lifeless patches of last year s grass bare and uncovered like the head of a sighing old grandmother For me that was one of the most beautiful nights I can remember The people I passed under the haloed streetlights were murmuring shadows and all of them seemed to be lovers walking with hands and eyes linked The melting snow dripped and ran dripped and ran and from every dark storm drain the sound of the sea drifted up a dark winter sea now strongly ebbing I walked until nearly midnight until I was thoroughly mildewed and I passed many shadows heard many footfalls clicking dreamily off down the winding paths Who is to say that one of those shadows was not the man or the thing that came to be known as Springheel Jack Not I for I passed many shadows but in the fog I saw no faces The next morning the clamor in the hall woke me I blundered out to see who had been drafted combing my hair with both hands and running the fuzzy caterpillar that had craftily replaced my tongue across the dry roof of my mouth He got another one someone said to me his face pallid with excitement They had to let him go Who go Amalara someone else said gleefully He was sitting in jail when it happened When what happened I asked patiently Sooner or later I would get it I was sure of that The guy killed somebody else last night And now they re hunting all over for it For what The pallid face wavered in front of me again Her head Whoever killed her took her head with him New Sharon isn t a big school now and was even smaller then the kind of institution the public relations people chummily refer to as a community college And it really was like a small community at least in those days between you and your friends you probably had at least a nodding acquaintance with everybody else and their friends Gale Cerman had been the type of girl you just nodded to thinking vaguely that you had seen her around We all knew Ann Bray She had been the first runner-up in the Miss New England pageant the year before her talent performance consisting of twirling a flaming baton to the tune of Hey Look Me Over She was brainy too until the time of her death she had been editor of the school newspaper a once-weekly rag with a lot of political cartoons and bombastic letters a member of the student dramatics society and president of the National Service Sorority New Sharon Branch In the hot fierce bubblings of my freshman youth I had submitted a column idea to the paper and asked for a date turned down on both counts And now she was dead worse than dead I walked to my afternoon classes like everyone else nodding to people I knew and saying hi with a little more force than usual as if that would make up for the close way I studied their faces Which was the same way they were studying mine There was someone dark among us as dark as the paths which twisted across the mall or wound among the hundred-year-old oaks on the quad in back of the gymnasium As dark as the hulking Civil War cannons seen through a drifting membrane of fog We looked into each other s faces and tried to read the darkness behind one of them This time the police arrested no one The blue beetles patrolled the campus ceaselessly on the foggy spring nights of the eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth and spotlights stabbed into dark nooks and crannies with erratic eagerness The administration imposed a mandatory nine o clock curfew A foolhardy couple discovered necking in the landscaped bushes north of the Tate Alumni Building were taken to the New Sharon police station and grilled unmercifully for three hours There was a hysterical false alarm on the twentieth when a boy was found unconscious in the same parking lot where the body of Gale Cerman had been found A gibbering campus cop loaded him into the back of his cruiser and put a map of the county over his face without bothering to hunt for a pulse and started toward the local hospital siren wailing across the deserted campus like a seminar of banshees Halfway there the corpse in the back seat had risen and asked hollowly Where the hell am I The cop shrieked and ran off the road The corpse turned out to be an undergrad named Donald Morris who had been in bed the last two days with a pretty lively case of flu was it Asian that year I can t remember Anyway he fainted in the parking lot on his way to the Grinder for a bowl of soup and some toast The days continued warm and overcast People clustered in small groups that had a tendency to break up and re-form with surprising speed Looking at the same set of faces for too long gave you funny ideas about some of them And the speed with which rumors swept from one end of the campus to the other began to approach the speed of light a well-liked history professor had been overheard laughing and weeping down by the small bridge Gale Cerman had left a cryptic two-word message written in her own blood on the blacktop of the Animal Sciences parking lot both murders were actually political crimes ritual murders that had been performed by an offshoot of the SDS to protest the war This was really laughable The New Sharon SDS had seven members One fair-sized offshoot would have bankrupted the whole organization This fact brought an even more sinister embellishment from the campus right-wingers outside agitators So during those queer warm days we all kept our eyes peeled for them The press always fickle ignored the strong resemblance our murderer bore to Jack the Ripper and dug further back all the way to Ann Bray had been found on a soggy path of ground some twelve feet from the nearest sidewalk and yet there were no footprints not even her own An enterprising New Hampshire newsman with a passion for the arcane christened the killer Springheel Jack after the infamous Dr John Hawkins of Bristol who did five of his wives to death with odd pharmaceutical knickknacks And the name probably because of that soggy yet unmarked ground stuck On the twenty-first it rained again and the mall and quadrangle became quagmires The police announced that they were salting plainclothes detectives men and women about and took half the police cars off duty The campus newspaper published a strongly indignant if slightly incoherent editorial protesting this The upshot of it seemed to be that with all sorts of cops masquerading as students it would be impossible to tell a real outside agitator from a false one Twilight came and the fog with it drifting up the tree-lined avenues slowly almost thoughtfully blotting out the buildings one by one It was soft insubstantial stuff but somehow implacable and frightening Springheel Jack was a man no one seemed to doubt that but the fog was his accomplice and it was female or so it seemed to me It was as if our little school was caught between them squeezed in some crazy lovers embrace part of a marriage that had been consummated in blood I sat and smoked and watched the lights come on in the growing darkness and wondered if it was all over My roommate came in and shut the door quietly behind him It s going to snow soon he said I turned around and looked at him Does the radio say that No he said Who needs a weatherman Have you ever heard of strawberry spring Maybe I said Along time ago Something grandmothers talk about isn t it He stood beside me looking out at the creeping dark Strawberry spring is like Indian summer he said only much more rare You get a good Indian summer in this part of the country once every two or three years A spell of weather like we ve been having is supposed to come only every eight or ten It s a false spring a lying spring like Indian summer is a false summer My own grandmother used to say strawberry spring means the worst norther of the winter is still on the way and the longer this lasts the harder the storm Folk tales I said Never believe a word I looked at him But I m nervous Are you He smiled benevolently and stole one of my cigarettes from the open pack on the window ledge I suspect everyone but me and thee he said and then the smile faded a little And sometimes I wonder about thee Want to go over to the Union and shoot some eight-ball I ll spot you ten Trig prelim next week I m going to settle down with a magic marker and a hot pile of notes For a long time after he was gone I could only look out the window And even after I had opened my book and started in part of me was still out there walking in the shadows where something dark was now in charge That night Adelle Parkins was killed Six police cars and seventeen collegiate-looking plainclothesmen eight of them were women imported all the way from Boston patrolled the campus But Springheel Jack killed her just the same going unerringly for one of our own The false spring the lying spring aided and abetted him he killed her and left her propped behind the wheel of her Dodge to be found the next morning and they found part of her in the back seat and part of her in the trunk And written in blood on the windshield this time fact instead of rumor were two words HA HA The campus went slightly mad after that all of us and none of us had known Adelle Parkins She was one of those nameless harried women who worked the break-back shift in the Grinder from six to eleven at night facing hordes of hamburger-happy students on study break from the library across the way She must have had it relatively easy those last three foggy nights of her life the curfew was being rigidly observed and after nine the Grinder s only patrons were hungry cops and happy janitors the empty buildings had improved their habitual bad temper considerably There is little left to tell The police as prone to hysteria as any of us and driven against the wall arrested an innocuous homosexual sociology graduate student named Hanson Gray who claimed he could not remember where he had spent several of the lethal evenings They charged him arraigned him and let him go to scamper hurriedly back to his native New Hampshire town after the last unspeakable night of strawberry spring when Marsha Curran was slaughtered on the mall Why she had been out and alone is forever beyond knowing she was a fat sadly pretty thing who lived in an apartment in town with three other girls She had slipped on campus as silently and as easily as Springheel Jack himself What brought her Perhaps her need was as deep and as ungovernable as her killer s and just as far beyond understanding Maybe a need for one desperate and passionate romance with the warm night the warm fog the smell of the sea and the cold knife That was on the twenty-third On the twenty-fourth the president of the college announced that spring break would be moved up a week and we scattered not joyfully but like frightened sheep before a storm leaving the campus empty and haunted by the police and one dark specter I had my own car on campus and I took six people down-state with me their luggage crammed in helter-skelter It wasn t a pleasant ride For all any of us knew Springheel Jack might have been in the car with us That night the thermometer dropped fifteen degrees and the whole northern New England area was belted by a shrieking norther that began in sleet and ended in a foot of snow The usual number of old duffers had heart attacks shoveling it away and then like magic it was April Clean showers and starry nights They called it strawberry spring God knows why and it s an evil lying time that only comes once every eight or ten years Springheel Jack left with the fog and by early June campus conversation had turned to a series of draft protests and a sit-in at the building where a well-known napalm manufacturer was holding job interviews By June the subject of Springheel Jack was almost unanimously avoided at least aloud I suspect there were many who turned it over and over privately looking for the one crack in the seamless egg of madness that would make sense of it all That was the year I graduated and the next year was the year I married A good job in a local publishing house In we had a child and now he s almost school age A fine and questing boy with my eyes and her mouth Then today s paper Of course I knew it was here I knew it yesterday morning when I got up and heard the mysterious sound of snowmelt mnning down the gutters and smelled the salt tang of the ocean from our front porch nine miles from the nearest beach I knew strawberry spring had come again when I started home from work last night and had to turn on my headlights against the mist that was already beginning to creep out of the fields and hollows blurring the lines of the buildings and putting fairy haloes around the streetlamps This morning s paper says a girl was killed on the New Sharon campus near the Civil War cannons She was killed last night and found in a melting snowbank She was not she was not all there My wife is upset She wants to know where I was last night I can t tell her because I don t remember I remember starting home from work and I remember putting my headlights on to search my way through the lovely creeping fog but that s all I remember I ve been thinking about that foggy night when I had a headache and walked for air and passed all the lovely shadows without shape or substance And I ve been thinking about the trunk of my car such an ugly word trunk and wondering why in the world I should be afraid to open it I can hear my wife as I write this in the next room crying She thinks I was with another woman last night And oh dear God I think so too THE LEDGE Go on Cressner said again Look in the bag We were in his penthouse apartment forty-three stories up The carpet was deep-cut pile burnt orange In the middle between the Basque sling chair where Cressner sat and the genuine leather couch where no one at all sat there was a brown shopping bag If it s a payoff forget it I said I love her It s money but it s not a payoff Go on Look He was smoking a Turkish cigarette in an onyx holder The air-circulation system allowed me just a dry whiff of the tobacco and then whipped it away He was wearing a silk dressing gown on which a dragon was embroidered His eyes were calm and intelligent behind his glasses He looked just like what he was an A-number-one carat dyed-in-the-wool son of a bitch I loved his wife and she loved me I had expected him to make trouble and I knew this was it but I just wasn t sure what brand it was I went to the shopping bag and tipped it over Banded bundles of currency tumbled out on the rug All twenties I picked one of the bundles up and counted Ten bills to a bundle There were a lot of bundles Twenty thousand dollars he said and puffed on his cigarette I stood up Okay It s for you I don t want it My wife comes with it I didn t say anything Marcia had warned me how it would be He s like a cat she had said An old torn full of meanness He ll try to make you a mouse So you re a tennis pro he said I don t believe I ve ever actually seen one before You mean your detectives didn t get any pictures Oh yes He waved the cigarette holder negligently Even a motion picture of the two of you in that Bayside Motel A camera was behind the mirror But pictures are hardly the same are they If you say so He ll keep changing tacks Marcia had said It s the way he puts people on the defensive Pretty soon he ll have you hitting out at where you think he s going to be and he ll get you someplace else Say as little as possible Stan And remember that I love you I invited you up because I thought we should have a little man-to-man chat Mr Norris Just a pleasant conversation between two civilized human beings one of whom has made off with the other s wife I started to answer but decided not to Did you enjoy San Quentin Cressner said puffing lazily Not particularly I believe you passed three years there A charge of breaking and entering if I m correct Marcia knows about it I said and immediately wished I hadn t I was playing his game just what Marcia had warned against Hitting soft lobs for him to smash back I ve taken the liberty of having your car moved he said glancing out the window at the far end of the room It really wasn t a window at all the whole wall was glass In the middle was a sliding-glass door Beyond it a balcony the size of a postage stamp Beyond that a very long drop There was something strange about the door I couldn t quite put my finger on it This is a very pleasant building Cressner said Good security Closed-circuit TV and all that When I knew you were in the lobby I made a telephone call An employee then hot-wired the ignition of your car and moved it from the parking area here to a public lot several blocks away He glanced up at the modernistic sunburst clock above the couch It was At the same employee will call the police from a public phone booth concerning your car By at the latest the minions of the law will have discovered over six ounces of heroin hidden in the spare tire of your trunk You will be eagerly sought after Mr Norris He had set me up I had tried to cover myself as well as I could but in the end I had been child s play for him These things will happen unless I call my employee and tell him to forget the phone call And all I have to do is tell you where Marcia is I said No deal Cressner I don t know We set it up this way just for you My men had her followed I don t think so I think we lost them at the airport Cressner sighed removed the smoldering cigarette holder and dropped it into a chromium ashtray with a sliding lid No fuss no muss The used cigarette and Stan Norris had been taken care of with equal ease Actually he said you re right The old ladies room vanishing act My operatives were extremely vexed to have been taken in by such an ancient ruse I think it was so old they never expected it I said nothing After Marcia had ditched Cressner s operatives at the airport she had taken the bus shuttle back to the city and then to the bus station that had been the plan She had two hundred dollars all the money that had been in my savings account Two hundred dollars and a Greyhound bus could take you anyplace in the country Are you always so uncommunicative Cressner asked and he sounded genuinely interested Marcia advised it A little more sharply he said Then I imagine you ll stand on your rights when the police take you in And the next time you see my wife could be when she s a little old grandmother in a rocker Have you gotten that through your head I understand that possession of six ounces of heroin could get you forty years That won t get you Marcia back He smiled thinly And that s the nub of it isn t it Shall I review where we are You and my wife have fallen in love You have had an affair if you want to call a series of one-nighters in cheap motels an affair My wife has left me However I have you And you are in what is called a bind Does that summarize it adequately I can understand why she got tired of you I said To my surprise he threw back his head and laughed You know I rather like you Mr Norris You re vulgar and you re a piker but you seem to have heart Marcia said you did I rather doubted it Her judgment of character is lax But you do have a certain verve Which is why I ve set things up the way I have No doubt Marcia has told you that I am fond of wagering Yes Now I knew what was wrong with the door in the middle of the glass wall It was the middle of winter and no one was going to want to take tea on a balcony forty- three stories up The balcony had been cleared of furniture And the screen had been taken off the door Now why would Cressner have done that I don t like my wife very much Cressner said fixing another cigarette carefully in the holder That s no secret I m sure she s told you as much And I m sure a man of your experience knows that contented wives do not jump into the hay with the local tennis-club pro at the drop of a racket In my opinion Marcia is a prissy whey-faced little prude a whiner a weeper a bearer of tales a That s about enough I said He smiled coldly I beg your pardon I keep forgetting we are discussing your beloved It s Are you nervous I shrugged Tough to the end he said and lit his cigarette At any rate you may wonder why if I dislike Marcia so much I do not simply give her her freedom No I don t wonder at all He frowned at me You re a selfish grasping egocentric son of a bitch That s why No one takes what s yours Not even if you don t want it anymore He went red and then laughed One for you Mr Norris Very good I shrugged again I m going to offer you a wager If you win you leave here with the money the woman and your freedom On the other hand if you lose you lose your life I looked at the clock I couldn t help it It was All right I said What else It would buy time at least Time for me to think of some way to beat it out of here with or without the money Cressner picked up the telephone beside him and dialed a number Tony Plan two Yes He hung up What s plan two I asked I ll call Tony back in fifteen minutes and he will remove the offending substance from the trunk of your car and drive it back here If I don t call he will get in touch with the police Not very trusting are you Be sensible Mr Norris There is twenty thousand dollars on the carpet between us In this city murder has been committed for twenty cents What s the bet He looked genuinely pained Wager Mr Norris wager Gentlemen make wagers Vulgarians place bets Whatever you say Excellent I ve seen you looking at my balcony The screen s off the door Yes I had it taken off this afternoon What I propose is this that you walk around my building on the ledge that juts out just below the penthouse level If you circumnavigate the building successfully the jackpot is yours You re crazy On the contrary I have proposed this wager six times to six different people during my dozen years in this apartment Three of the six were professional athletes like you one of them a notorious quarterback more famous for his TV Commercials than his passing game one a baseball player one a rather famous jockey who made an extraordinary yearly salary and who was also afflicted with extraordinary alimony problems The other three were more ordinary citizens who had differing professions but two things in common a need for money and a certain degree of body grace He puffed his cigarette thoughtfully and then continued The wager was declined five times out of hand On the other occasion it was accepted The terms were twenty thousand dollars against six months service to me I collected The fellow took one look over the edge of the balcony and nearly fainted Cressner looked amused and contemptuous He said everything down there looked so small That was what killed his nerve What makes you think He cut me off with an annoyed wave of his hand Don t bore me Mr Norris I think you will do it because you have no choice It s my wager on the one hand or forty years in San Quentin on the other The money and my wife are only added fillips indicative of my good nature What guarantee do I have that you won t double-cross me Maybe I d do it and find out you d called Tony and told him to go ahead anyway He sighed You are a walking case of paranoia Mr Norris I don t love my wife It is doing my storied ego no good at all to have her around Twenty thousand dollars is a pittance to me I pay four times that every week to be given to police bagmen As for the wager however His eyes gleamed That is beyond price I thought about it and he left me I suppose he knew that the real mark always convinces himself I was a thirty-six-year-old tennis bum and the club had been thinking of letting me go when Marcia applied a little gentle pressure Tennis was the only profession I knew and without it even getting a job as a janitor would be tough especially with a record It was kid stuff but employers don t care And the funny thing was that I really loved Marcia Cressner I had fallen for her after two nine-o clock tennis lessons and she had fallen for me just as hard It was a case of Stan Norris luck all right After thirty-six years of happy bachelorhood I had fallen like a sack of mail for the wife of an Organization overlord The old tom sitting there and puffing his imported Turkish cigarette knew all that of course And something else as well I had no guarantee that he wouldn t turn me in if I accepted his wager and won but I knew damn well that I d be in the cooler by ten o clock if I didn t And the next time I d be free would be at the turn of the century I want to know one thing I said What might that be Mr Norris Look me right in the face and tell me if you re a welsher or not He looked at me directly Mr Norris he said quietly I never welsh All right I said What other choice was there He stood up beaming Excellent Really excellent Approach the door to the balcony with me Mr Norris We walked over together His face was that of a man who had dreamed this scene hundreds of times and was enjoying its actuality to the fullest The ledge is five inches wide he said dreamily I ve measured it myself In fact I ve stood on it holding on to the balcony of course All you have to do is lower yourself over the wrought-iron railing You ll be chest-high But of course beyond the railing there are no handgrips You ll have to inch your way along being very careful not to overbalance My eye had fastened on something else outside the window something that made my blood temperature sink several degrees It was a wind gauge Cressner s apartment was quite close to the lake and it was high enough so there were no higher buildings to act as a windbreak That wind would be cold and it would cut like a knife The needle was standing at ten pretty steadily but a gust would send the needle almost up to twenty-five for a few seconds before dropping off Ah I see you ve noticed my wind gauge Cressner said jovially Actually it s the other side which gets the prevailing wind so the breeze may be a little stronger on that side But actually this is a fairly still night I ve seen evenings when the wind has gusted up to eighty-five you can actually feel the building rock a little A bit like being on a ship in the crow s nest And it s quite mild for this time of year He pointed and I saw the lighted numerals atop a bank skyscraper to the left They said it was forty-four degrees But with the wind that would have made the chill factor somewhere in the mid-twenties Have you got a coat I asked I was wearing a light jacket Alas no The lighted figures on the bank switched to show the time It was And I think you had better get started Mr Norris so I can call Tony and put plan three into effect A good boy but apt to be impulsive You understand I understood all right Too damn well But the thought of being with Marcia free from Cressner s tentacles and with enough money to get started at something made me push open the sliding-glass door and step out onto the balcony It was cold and damp the wind ruffled my hair into my eyes Bon soir Cressner said behind me but I didn t bother to look back I approached the railing but I didn t look down Not yet I began to do deep-breathing It s not really an exercise at ah but a form of self-hypnosis With every inhale-exhale you throw a distraction out of your mind until there s nothing left but the match ahead of you I got rid of the money with one breath and Cressner himself with two Marcia took longer her face kept rising in my mind telling me not to be stupid not to play his game that maybe Cressner never welshed but he always hedged his bets I didn t listen I couldn t afford to If I lost this match I wouldn t have to buy the beers and take the ribbing I d be so much scarlet sludge splattered for a block of Deakman Street in both directions When I thought I had it I looked down The building sloped away like a smooth chalk cliff to the street far below The cars parked there looked like those match-box models you can buy in the five-and-dime The ones driving by the building were just tiny pinpoints of light If you fell that far you would have plenty of time to realize just what was happening to see the wind blowing your clothes as the earth pulled you back faster and faster You d have time to scream a long long scream And the sound you made when you hit the pavement would be like the sound of an overripe watermelon I could understand why that other guy had chickened out But he d only had six months to worry about I was staring forty long gray Marcia-less years in the eye I looked at the ledge It looked small I had never seen five inches that looked so much like two At least the building was fairly new it wouldn t crumble under me I hoped I swung over the railing and carefully lowered myself until I was standing on the ledge My heels were out over the drop The floor on the balcony was about chest-high and I was looking into Cressner s penthouse through the wrought-iron ornamental bars He was standing inside the door smoking watching me the way a scientist watches a guinea pig to see what the latest injection will do Call I said holding on to the railing What Call Tony I don t move until you do He went back into the living room it looked amazingly warm and safe and cozy and picked up the phone It was a worthless gesture really With the wind I couldn t hear what he was saying He put the phone down and returned Taken care of Mr Norris It better be Goodbye Mr Norris I ll see you in a bit perhaps It was time to do it Talking was done I let myself think of Marcia one last time her light-brown hair her wide gray eyes her lovely body and then put her out of my mind for good No more looking down either It would have been too easy to get paralyzed looking down through that space Too easy to just freeze up until you lost your balance or just fainted from fear It was time for tunnel vision Time to concentrate on nothing but left foot right foot I began to move to the right holding on to the balcony s railing as long as I could It didn t take long to see I was going to need all the tennis muscle my ankles had With my heels beyond the edge those tendons would be taking all my weight I got to the end of the balcony and for a moment I didn t think I was going to be able to let go of that safety I forced myself to do it Five inches hell that was plenty of room If the ledge were only a foot off the ground instead of feet you could breeze around this building in four minutes flat I told myself So just pretend it is Yeah and if you fall from a ledge a foot off the ground you just say rats and try again Up here you get only one chance I slid my right foot farther and then brought my left foot next to it I let go of the railing I put my open hands up allowing the palms to rest against the rough stone of the apartment building I caressed the stone I could have kissed it A gust of wind hit me snapping the collar of my jacket against my face making my body sway on the ledge My heart jumped into my throat and stayed there until the wind had died down A strong enough gust would have peeled me right off my perch and sent me flying down into the night And the wind would be stronger on the other side I turned my head to the left pressing my cheek against the stone Cressner was leaning over the balcony watching me Enjoying yourself he asked affably He was wearing a brown camel s-hair overcoat I thought you didn t have a coat I said I lied he answered equably I lie about a lot of things What s that supposed to mean Nothing nothing at all Or perhaps it does mean something A little psychological warfare eh Mr Norris I should tell you not to linger overlong The ankles grow tired and if they should give way He took an apple out of his pocket bit into it and then tossed it over the edge There was no sound for a long time Then a faint and sickening plop Cressner chuckled He had broken my concentration and I could feel panic nibbling at the edges of my mind with steel teeth A torrent of terror wanted to msh in and drown me I turned my head away from him and did deep-breathing flushing the panic away I was looking at the lighted bank sign which now said Time to Save at Mutual By the time the lighted numbers read felt that I had myself under control again I think Cressner must have decided I d frozen and I heard a sardonic patter of applause when I began to shuffle toward the corner of the building again I began to feel the cold The lake had whetted the edge of the wind its clammy dampness bit at my skin like an auger My thin jacket billowed out behind me as I shuffled along I moved slowly cold or not If I was going to do this I would have to do it slowly and deliberately If I rushed I would fall The bank clock read when I reached the corner It didn t appear to be a problem the ledge went right around making a square corner but my right hand told me that there was a crosswind If I got caught leaning the wrong way I would take a long ride very quickly I waited for the wind to drop but for a long time it refused to almost as though it were Cressner s willing ally It slapped against me with vicious invisible fingers prying and poking and tickling At last after a particularly strong gust had made me rock on my toes I knew that I could wait forever and the wind would never drop all the way off So the next time it sank a little I slipped my right foot around and clutching both walls with my hands made the turn The crosswind pushed me two ways at once and I tottered For a second I was sickeningly sure that Cressner had won his wager Then I slid a step farther along and pressed myself tightly against the wall a held breath slipping out of my dry throat That was when the raspberry went off almost in my ear Startled I jerked back to the very edge of balance My hands lost the wall and pinwheeled crazily for balance I think that if one of them had hit the stone face of the building I would have been gone But after what seemed an eternity gravity decided to let me return to the wall instead of sending me down to the pavement forty-three stories below My breath sobbed out of my lungs in a pained whistle My legs were rubbery The tendons in my ankles were humming like high-voltage wires I had never felt so mortal The man with the sickle was close enough to read over my shoulder I twisted my neck looked up and there was Cressner leaning out of his bedroom window four feet above me He was smiling in his right hand he held a New Year s Eve noisemaker Just keeping you on your toes he said I didn t waste my breath I couldn t have spoken above a croak anyway My heart was thudding crazily in my chest I sidled five or six feet along just in case he was thinking about leaning out and giving me a good shove Then I stopped and closed my eyes and deep-breathed until I had my act back together again I was on the short side of the building now On my right only the highest towers of the city bulked above me On the left only the dark circle of the lake with a few pinpricks of light which floated on it The wind whooped and moaned The crosswind at the second corner was not so tricky and I made it around with no trouble And then something bit me I gasped and jerked The shift of balance scared me and I pressed tightly against the building I was bitten again No not bitten but pecked I looked down There was a pigeon standing on the ledge looking up with bright hateful eyes You get used to pigeons in the city they re as common as cab drivers who can t change a ten They don t like to fly and they give ground grudgingly as if the sidewalks were theirs by squatters rights Oh yes and you re apt to find their calling cards on the hood of your car But you never take much notice They may be occasionally irritating but they re interlopers in our world But I was in his and I was nearly helpless and he seemed to know it He pecked my tired right ankle again sending a bright dart of pain up my leg Get I snarled at it Get out The pigeon only pecked me again I was obviously in what he regarded as his home this section of the ledge was covered with droppings old and new A muted cheeping from above I cricked my neck as far back as it would go and looked up A beak darted at my face and I almost recoiled If I had I might have become the city s first pigeon-induced casualty It was Mama Pigeon protecting a bunch of baby pigeons just under the slight overhang of the roof Too far up to peck my head thank God Her husband pecked me again and now blood was flowing I could feel it I began to inch my way along again hoping to scare the pigeon off the ledge No way Pigeons don t scare not city pigeons anyway If a moving van only makes them amble a little faster a man pinned on a high ledge isn t going to upset them at all The pigeon backpedaled as I shuffled forward his bright eyes never leaving my face except when the sharp beak dipped to peck my ankle And the pain was getting more intense now the bird was pecking at raw flesh and eating it for all I knew I kicked at it with my right foot It was a weak kick the only kind I could afford The pigeon only fluttered its wings a bit and then returned to the attack I on the other hand almost went off the side The pigeon pecked me again again again A cold blast of wind struck me rocking me to the limit of balance pads of my fingers scraped at the bland stone and I came to rest with my left cheek pressed against the wall breathing heavily Cressner couldn t have conceived of worse torture if he had planned it for ten years One peck was not so bad Two or three were little more But that damned bird must have pecked me sixty times before I reached the wrought-iron railing of the penthouse opposite Cressner s Reaching that railing was like reaching the gates of heaven My hands curled sweetly around the cold uprights and held on as if they would never let go Peck The pigeon was staring up at me almost smugly with its bright eyes confident of my impotence and its own invulnerability I was reminded of Cressner s expression when he had ushered me out onto the balcony on the other side of the building Gripping the iron bars more tightly I lashed out with a hard strong kick and caught the pigeon squarely It emitted a wholly satisfying squawk and rose into the air wings flapping A few feathers dove gray settled back to the ledge or disappeared slowly down into the darkness swan-boating back and forth in the air Gasping I crawled up onto the balcony and collapsed there Despite the cold my body was dripping with sweat I don t know how long I lay there recuperating The building hid the bank clock and I don t wear a watch I sat up before my muscles could stiffen up on me and gingerly rolled down my sock The right ankle was lacerated and bleeding but the wound looked superficial Still I would have to have it taken care of if I ever got out of this God knows what germs pigeons carry around I thought of bandaging the raw skin but decided not to I might stumble on a tied bandage Time enough later Then I could buy twenty thousand dollars worth of bandages I got up and looked longingly into the darkened penthouse opposite Cressner s Barren empty unlived in The heavy storm screen was over this door I might have been able to break in but that would have been forfeiting the bet And I had more to lose than money When I could put it off no longer I slipped over the railing and back onto the ledge The pigeon a few feathers worse for wear was standing below his mate s nest where the guano was thickest eyeing me balefully But I didn t think he d bother me not when he saw I was moving away It was very hard to move away much harder than it had been to leave Cressner s balcony My mind knew I had to but my body particularly my ankles was screaming that it would be folly to leave such a safe harbor But I did leave with Marcia s face in the darkness urging me on I got to the second short side made it around the corner and shuffled slowly across the width of the building Now that I was getting close there was an almost ungovernable urge to hurry to get it over with But if I hurried I would die So I forced myself to go slowly The crosswind almost got me again on the fourth corner and I slipped around it thanks to luck rather than skill I rested against the building getting my breath back But for the first time I knew that I was going to make it that I was going to win My hands felt like half-frozen steaks my ankles hurt like fire especially the pigeon-pecked right ankle sweat kept trickling in my eyes but I knew I was going to make it Halfway down the length of the building warm yellow light spilled out on Cressner s balcony Far beyond I could see the bank sign glowing like a welcome-home banner It was but it seemed that I had spent my whole life on those five inches of ledge And God help Cressner if he tried to welsh The urge to hurry was gone I almost lingered It was when I put first my right hand on the wrought-iron balcony railing and then my left I hauled myself up wriggled over the top collapsed thankfully on the floor and felt the cold steel muzzle of a against my temple I looked up and saw a goon ugly enough to stop Big Ben dead in its clockwork He was grinning Excellent Cressner s voice said from within I applaud you Mr Norris He proceeded to do just that Bring him in Tony Tony hauled me up and set me on my feet so abruptly that my weak ankles almost buckled Going in I staggered against the balcony door Cressner was standing by the living-room fireplace sipping brandy from a goblet the size of a fishbowl The money had been replaced in the shopping bag It still stood in the middle of the burnt-orange rug I caught a glimpse of myself in a small mirror on the other side of the room The hair was disheveled the face pallid except for two bright spots of color on the cheeks The eyes looked insane I got only a glimpse because the next moment I was flying across the room I hit the Basque chair and fell over it pulling it down on top of me and losing my wind When I got some of it back I sat up and managed You lousy welsher You had this planned Indeed I did Cressner said carefully setting his brandy on the mantel But I m not a welsher Mr Norris Indeed no Just an extremely poor loser Tony is here only to make sure you don t do anything ill-advised He put his fingers under his chin and tittered a little He didn t look like a poor loser He looked more like a cat with canary feathers on its muzzle I got up suddenly feeling more frightened than I had on the ledge You fixed it I said slowly Somehow you fixed it Not at all The heroin has been removed from your car The car itself is back in the parking lot The money is over there You may take it and go Fine I said Tony stood by the glass door to the balcony still looking like a leftover from Halloween The was in his hand I walked over to the shopping bag picked it up and walked toward the door on my jittery ankles fully expecting to be shot down in my tracks But when I got the door open I began to have the same feeling that I d had on the ledge when I rounded the fourth corner I was going to make it Cressner s voice lazy and amused stopped me You don t really think that old lady s-room dodge fooled anyone do you I turned back slowly the shopping bag in my arms What do you mean I told you I never welsh and I never do You won three things Mr Norris The money your freedom my wife You have the first two You can pick up the third at the county morgue I stared at him unable to move frozen in a soundless thunderclap of shock You didn t really think I d let you have her he asked me pityingly Oh no The money yes Your freedom yes But not Marcia Still I don t welsh And after you ve had her buried I didn t go near him Not then He was for later I walked toward Tony who looked slightly surprised until Cressner said in a bored voice Shoot him please I threw the bag of money It hit him squarely in the gun hand and it struck him hard I hadn t been using my arms and wrists out there and they re the best part of any tennis player His bullet went into the burnt-orange rug and then I had him His face was the toughest part of him I yanked the gun out of his hand and hit him across the bridge of the nose with the barrel He went down with a single very weary grunt looking like Rondo Hatton Cressner was almost out the door when I snapped a shot over his shoulder and said Stop right there or you re dead He thought about it and stopped When he turned around his cosmopolitan world- weary act had curdled a little around the edges It curdled a little more when he saw Tony lying on the floor and choking on his own blood She s not dead he said quickly I had to salvage something didn t I He gave me a sick cheese-eating grin I m a sucker but I m not that big a sucker I said My voice sounded lifeless dead Why not Marcia had been my life and this man had put her on a slab With a finger that trembled slightly Cressner pointed at the money tumbled around Tony s feet That he said that s chickenfeed I can get you a hundred thousand Or five Or how about a million all of it in a Swiss bank account How about that How about I ll make you a bet I said slowly He looked from the barrel of the gun to my face A Abet I repeated Not a wager Just a plain old bet I ll bet you can t walk around this building on the ledge out there His face went dead pale For a moment I thought he was going to faint You he whispered These are the stakes I said in my dead voice If you make it I ll let you go How s that No he whispered His eyes were huge staring Okay I said and cocked the pistol No he said holding his hands out No Don t I all right He licked his lips I motioned with the gun and he preceded me out onto the balcony You re shaking I told him That s going to make it harder Two million he said and he couldn t get his voice above a husky whine Two million in unmarked bills No I said Not for ten million But if you make it you go free I m serious A minute later he was standing on the ledge He was shorter than I you could just see his eyes over the edge wide and beseeching and his white-knuckled hands gripping the iron rail like prison bars Please he whispered Anything You re wasting time I said It takes it out of the ankles But he wouldn t move until I had put the muzzle of the gun against his forehead Then he began to shuffle to the right moaning I glanced up at the bank clock It was I didn t think he was going to make it to the first corner He didn t want to budge at all and when he did he moved jerkily taking risks with his center of gravity his dressing gown billowing into the night He disappeared around the corner and out of sight at almost forty minutes ago I listened closely for the diminishing scream as the crosswind got him but it didn t come Maybe the wind had dropped I do remember thinking the wind was on his side when I was out there Or maybe he was just lucky Maybe he s out on the other balcony now quivering in a heap afraid to go any farther But he probably knows that if I catch him there when I break into the other penthouse I ll shoot him down like a dog And speaking of the other side of the building I wonder how he likes that pigeon Was that a scream I don t know It might have been the wind It doesn t matter The bank clock says Pretty soon I ll break into the other apartment and check the balcony but right now I m just sitting here on Cressner s balcony with Tony s in my hand Just on the off chance that he might come around that last corner with his dressing gown billowing out behind him Cressner said he s never welshed on a bet But I ve been known to THE LAWNMOWER MAN In previous years Harold Parkette had always taken pride in his lawn He had owned a large silver Lawnboy and paid the boy down the block five dollars per cutting to push it In those days Harold Parkette had followed the Boston Red Sox on the radio with a beer in his hand and the knowledge that God was in his heaven and all was right with the world including his lawn But last year in mid-October fate had played Harold Parkette a nasty trick While the boy was mowing the grass for the last time of the season the Castonmeyers dog had chased the Smiths cat under the mower Harold s daughter had thrown up half a quart of cherry Kool-Aid into the lap of her new jumper and his wife had nightmares for a week afterward Although she had arrived after the fact she had arrived in time to see Harold and the green-faced boy cleaning the blades Their daughter and Mrs Smith stood over them weeping although Alicia had taken time enough to change her jumper for a pair of blue jeans and one of those disgusting skimpy sweaters She had a crush on the boy who mowed the lawn After a week of listening to his wife moan and gobble in the next bed Harold decided to get rid of the mower He didn t really need a mower anyway he supposed He had hired a boy this year next year he would just hire a boy and a mower And maybe Carla would stop moaning in her sleep He might even get laid again So he took the silver Lawnboy down to Phil s Sunoco and he and Phil dickered over it Harold came away with a brand-new Kelly blackwall tire and a tankful of hi-test and Phil put the silver Lawnboy out on one of the pump islands with a hand-lettered for sale sign on it And this year Harold just kept putting off the necessary hiring When he finally got around to calling last year s boy his mother told him Frank had gone to the state university Harold shook his head in wonder and went to the refrigerator to get a beer Time certainly flew didn t it My God yes He put off hiring a new boy as first May and then June slipped past him and the Red Sox continued to wallow in fourth place He sat on the back porch on the weekends and watched glumly as a never ending progression of young boys he had never seen before popped out to mutter a quick hello before taking his buxom daughter off to the local passion pit And the grass thrived and grew in a marvelous way It was a good summer for grass three days of shine followed by one of gentle rain almost like clockwork By mid-July the lawn looked more like a meadow than a suburbanite s backyard and Jack Castonmeyer had begun to make all sorts of extremely unfunny jokes most of which concerned the price of hay and alfalfa And Don Smith s four-year-old daughter Jenny had taken to hiding in it when there was oatmeal for breakfast or spinach for supper One day in late July Harold went out on the patio during the seventh-inning stretch and saw a woodchuck sitting perkily on the overgrown back walk The time had come he decided He flicked off the radio picked up the paper and turned to the classifieds And half way down the Part Time column he found this Lawns mowed Reasonable Harold called the number expecting a vacuuming house-wife who would yell outside for her son Instead a briskly professional voice said Pastoral Greenery and Outdoor Services how may we help you Cautiously Harold told the voice how Pastoral Greenery could help him Had it come to this then Were lawncutters starting their own businesses and hiring office help He asked the voice about rates and the voice quoted him a reasonable figure Harold hung up with a lingering feeling of unease and went back to the porch He sat down turned on the radio and stared out over his glandular lawn at the Saturday clouds moving slowly across the Saturday sky Carla and Alicia were at his mother-in-law s and the house was his It would be a pleasant surprise for them if the boy who was coming to cut the lawn finished before they came back He cracked a beer and sighed as Dick Drago was touched for a double and then hit a batter A little breeze shuffled across the screened-in porch Crickets hummed softly in the long grass Harold grunted something unkind about Dick Drago and then dozed off He was jarred awake a half hour later by the doorbell He knocked over his beer getting up to answer it A man in grass-stained denim overalls stood on the front stoop chewing a toothpick He was fat The curve of his belly pushed his faded blue overall out to a point where Harold half suspected he had swallowed a basketball Yes Harold Parkette asked still half asleep The man grinned rolled his toothpick from one corner of his mouth to the other tugged at the seat of his overalls and then pushed his green baseball cap up a notch on his forehead There was a smear of fresh engine oil on the bill of his cap And there he was smelling of grass earth and oil grinning at Harold Parkett Pastoral sent me buddy he said jovially scratching his crotch You called right Right buddy He grinned on endlessly Oh The lawn You Harold stared stupidly Yep me The lawnmower man bellowed fresh laughter into Harold s sleep-puffy face Harold stood helplessly aside and the lawnmower man tromped ahead of him down the hall through the living room and kitchen and onto the back porch Now Harold had placed the man and everything was all right He had seen the type before working for the sanitation department and the highway repair crews out on the turnpike Always with a spare minute to lean on their shovels and smoke Lucky Strikes or Camels looking at you as if they were the salt of the earth able to hit you for five or sleep with your wife anytime they wanted to Harold had always been slightly afraid of men like this they were always tanned dark brown there were always nets of wrinkles around their eyes and they always knew what to do The back lawn s the real chore he told the man unconsciously deepening his voice It s square and there are no obstructions but it s pretty well grown up His voice faltered back into its normal register and he found himself apologizing I m afraid I ve let it go No sweat buddy No strain Great-great-great The lawnmower man grinned at him with a thousand traveling-salesman jokes in his eyes The taller the better Healthy soil that s what you got there by Circe That s what I always say By Circe The lawnmower man cocked his head at the radio Yastrzemski had just struck out Red Sox fan I m a Yankees man myself He clumped back into the house and down the front hall Harold watched him bitterly He sat back down and looked accusingly for a moment at the puddle of beer under the table with the overturned Coors can in the middle of it He thought of getting the mop from the kitchen and decided it would keep No sweat No strain He opened his paper to the financial section and cast a judicious eye at the closing stock quotations As a good Republican he considered the Wall Street executives behind the columned type to be at least minor demigods By Circe and he had wished many times that he could better understand the Word as handed down from the mount not on stone tablets but in such enigmatic abbreviations as pet and Kdk and up He had once bought a judicious three shares in a company called Midwest Bisonburgers Inc that had gone broke in He had lost his entire seventy- five-dollar investment Now he understood bisonburgers were quite the coming thing The wave of the future He had discussed this often with Sonny the bartender down at the Goldfish Bowl Sonny told Harold his trouble was that he was five years ahead of his time and he should A sudden racketing roar startled him out of the new doze he had just been slipping into Harold jumped to his feet knocking his chair over and staring around wildly That s a lawnmower Harold Parkette asked the kitchen My God that s a lawnmower He rushed through the house and stared out the front door There was nothing out there but a battered green van with the words pastoral greenery inc painted on the side The roaring sound was in back now Harold rushed through his house again burst onto the back porch and stood frozen It was obscene It was a travesty The aged red power mower the fat man had brought in his van was running on its own No one was pushing it in fact no one was within five feet of it It was running at a fever pitch tearing through the unfortunate grass of Harold Parkette s back lawn like an avenging red devil straight from hell It screamed and bellowed and farted oily blue smoke in a crazed kind of mechanical madness that made Harold feel ill with terror The overripe smell of cut grass hung in the air like sour wine But the lawnmower man was the true obscenity The lawnmower man had removed his clothes every stitch They were folded neatly in the empty birdbath that was at the center of the back lawn Naked and grass-stained he was crawling along about five feet behind the mower eating the cut grass Green juice ran down his chin and dripped onto his pendulous belly And every time the lawnmower whirled around a corner he rose and did an odd skipping jump before prostrating himself again Stop Harold Parkette screamed Stop that But the lawnmower man took no notice and his screaming scarlet familiar never slowed If anything it seemed to speed up Its nicked steel grill seemed to grin sweatily at Harold as it raved by Then Harold saw the mole It must have been hiding in stunned terror just ahead of the mower in the swath of grass about to be slaughtered It bolted across the cut band of lawn toward safety under the porch a panicky brown streak The lawnmower swerved Blatting and howling it roared over the mole and spat it out in a string of fur and entrails that reminded Harold of the Smiths cat The mole destroyed the lawnmower rushed back to the main job The lawnmower man crawled rapidly by eating grass Harold stood paralyzed with horror stocks bonds and bisonburgers completely forgotten He could actually see that huge pendulous belly expanding The lawnmower man swerved and ate the mole That was when Harold Parkette leaned out the screen door and vomited into the zinnias The world went gray and suddenly he realized he was fainting had fainted He collapsed backward onto the porch and closed his eyes Someone was shaking him Carla was shaking him He hadn t done the dishes or emptied the garbage and Carla was going to be very angry but that was all right As long as she was waking him up taking him out of the horrible dream he had been having back into the normal world nice normal Carla with her Playtex Living Girdle and her buck teeth Buck teeth yes But not Carla s buck teeth Carla had weak-looking chipmunk buck teeth But these teeth were Hairy Green hair was growing on these buck teeth It almost looked like Grass Oh my God Harold said You fainted buddy right huh The lawnmower man was bending over him grinning with his hairy teeth His lips and chin were hairy too Everything was hairy And green The yard stank of grass and gas and too sudden silence Harold bolted up to a sitting position and stared at the dead mower All the grass had been neatly cut And there would be no need to rake this job Harold observed sickly If the lawnmower man had missed a single cut blade he couldn t see it He squinted obliquely at the lawnmower man and winced He was still naked still fat still terrifying Green trickles ran from the corners of his mouth What is this Harold begged The man waved an arm benignly at the lawn This Well it s a new thing the boss has been trying It works out real good Real good buddy We re killing two birds with one stone We keep getting along toward the final stage and we re making money to support our other operations to boot See what I mean Of course every now and then we run into a customer who doesn t understand some people got no respect for efficiency right but the boss is always agreeable to a sacrifice Sort of keeps the wheels greased if you catch me Harold said nothing One word knelled over and over in his mind and that word was sacrifice In his mind s eye he saw the mole spewing out from under the battered red mower He got up slowly like a palsied old man Of course he said and could only come up with a line from one of Alicia s folk-rock records God bless the grass The lawnmower man slapped one summer-apple-colored thigh That s pretty good buddy In fact that s damned good I can see you got the right spirit Okay if I write that down when I get back to the office Might mean a promotion Certainly Harold said retreating toward the back door and striving to keep his melting smile in place You go right ahead and finish I think I ll take a little nap Sure buddy the lawnmower man said getting ponderously to his feet Harold noticed the unusually deep split between the first and second toes almost as if the feet were well cloven It hits everybody kinda hard at first the lawnmower man said You ll get used to it He eyed Harold s portly figure shrewdly In fact you might even want to give it a whirl yourself The boss has always got an eye out for new talent The boss Harold repeated faintly The lawnmower man paused at the bottom of the steps and gazed tolerantly up at Harold Parkette Well say buddy I figured you must have guessed God bless the grass and all Harold shook his head carefully and the lawnmower man laughed Pan Pan s the boss And he did a half hop half shuffle in the newly cut grass and the lawnmower screamed into life and began to trundle around the house The neighbors Harold began but the lawnmower man only waved cheerily and disappeared Out front the lawnmower blatted and howled Harold Parkette refused to look as if by refusing he could deny the grotesque spectacle that the Castonmeyers and Smiths wretched Democrats both were probably drinking in with horrified but no doubt righteously I-told-you-so eyes Instead of looking Harold went to the telephone snatched it up and dialed police headquarters from the emergency decal pasted on the phone s handset Sergeant Hall the voice at the other end said Harold stuck a finger in his free ear and said My name is Harold Parkette My address is East Endicott Street I d like to report What What would he like to report A man is in the process of raping and murdering my lawn and he works for a fellow named Pan and has cloven feet Yes Mr Parkette Inspiration struck I d like to report a case of indecent exposure Indecent exposure Sergeant Hall repeated Yes There s a man mowing my lawn He s in the uh altogether You mean he s naked Sergeant Hall asked politely incredulous Naked Harold agreed holding tightly to the frayed ends of his sanity Nude Unclothed Bare-assed On my front lawn Now will you get somebody the hell over here That address was West Endicott Sergeant Hall asked bemusedly East Harold yelled For God s sake And you say he s definitely naked You are able to observe his uh genitals and so on Harold tried to speak and could only gargle The sound of the insane lawnmower seemed to be growing louder and louder drowning out everything in the universe He felt his gorge rise Can you speak up Sergeant Hall buzzed There s an awfully noisy connection there at your end The front door crashed open Harold looked around and saw the lawnmower man s mechanized familiar advancing through the door Behind it came the lawnmower man himself still quite naked With something approaching true insanity Harold saw the man s pubic hair was a rich fertile green He was twirling his baseball cap on one finger That was a mistake buddy the lawnmower man said reproachfully You shoulda stuck with God bless the grass Hello Hello Mr Parkette The telephone dropped from Harold s nerveless fingers as the lawnmower began to advance on him cutting through the nap of Carla s new Mohawk rug and spitting out brown hunks of fiber as it came Harold stared at it with a kind of bird-and-snake fascination until it reached the coffee table When the mower shunted it aside shearing one leg into sawdust and splinters as it did so he climbed over the back of his chair and began to retreat toward the kitchen dragging the chair in front of him That won t do any good buddy the lawnmower man said kindly Apt to be messy too Now if you was just to show me where you keep your sharpest butcher knife we could get this sacrifice business out of the way real painless I think the birdbath would do and then Harold shoved the chair at the lawnmower which had been craftily flanking him while the naked man drew his attention and bolted through the doorway The lawnmower roared around the chair jetting out exhaust and as Harold smashed open the porch screen door and leaped down the steps he heard it smelled it felt it right at his heels The lawnmower roared off the top step like a skier going off a jump Harold sprinted across his newly cut back lawn but there had been too many beers too many afternoon naps He could sense it nearing him then on his heels and then he looked over his shoulder and tripped over his own feet The last thing Harold Parkette saw was the grinning grill of the charging lawnmower rocking back to reveal its flashing green-stained blades and above it the fat face of the lawnmower man shaking his head in good-natured reproof Hell of a thing Lieutenant Goodwin said as the last of the photographs were taken He nodded to the two men in white and they trundled their basket across the lawn He reported some naked guy on his lawn not two hours ago Is that so Patrolman Cooley asked Yeah One of the neighbors called in too Guy named Castonmeyer He thought it was Parkette himself Maybe it was Cooley Maybe it was Sir Crazy with the heat Lieutenant Goodwin said gravely and tapped his temple Schizo-fucking-phrenia Yes sir Cooley said respectfully Where s the rest of him one of the white-coats asked The birdbath Goodwin said He looked profoundly up at the sky Did you say the birdbath the white-coat asked Indeed I did Lieutenant Goodwin agreed Patrolman Cooley looked at the birdbath and suddenly lost most of his tan Sex maniac Lieutenant Goodwin said Must have been Prints Cooley asked thickly You might as well ask for footprints Goodwin said He gestured at the newly cut grass Patrolman Cooley made a strangled noise in his throat Lieutenant Goodwin stuffed his hands into his pockets and rocked back on his heels The world he said gravely is full of nuts Never forget that Cooley Schizos Lab boys say somebody chased Parkette through his own living room with a lawnmower Can you imagine that No sir Cooley said Goodwin looked out over Harold Parkette s neatly manicured lawn Well like the man said when he saw the black-haired Swede it surely is a Norse of a different color Goodwin strolled around the house and Cooley followed him Behind them the scent of newly mown grass hung pleasantly in the air QUITTERS INC Morrison was waiting for someone who was hung up in the air traffic jam over Kennedy International when he saw a familiar face at the end of the bar and walked down Jimmy Jimmy McCann It was A little heavier than when Morrison had seen him at the Atlanta Exhibition the year before but otherwise he looked awesomely fit In college he had been a thin pallid chain smoker buried behind huge horn-rimmed glasses He had apparently switched to contact lenses Dick Morrison Yeah You look great He extended his hand and they shook So do you McCann said but Morrison knew it was a lie He had been overworking overeating and smoking too much What are you drinking Bourbon and bitters Morrison said He hooked his feet around a bar stool and lighted a cigarette Meeting someone Jimmy No Going to Miami for a conference A heavy client Bills six million I m supposed to hold his hand because we lost out on a big special next spring Are you still with Crager and Barton Executive veep now Fantastic Congratulations When did all this happen He tried to tell himself that the little worm of jealousy in his stomach was just acid indigestion He pulled out a roll of antacid pills and crunched one in his mouth Last August Something happened that changed my life He looked speculatively at Morrison and sipped his drink You might be interested My God Morrison thought with an inner wince Jimmy McCann s got religion Sure he said and gulped at his drink when it came I wasn t in very good shape McCann said Personal problems with Sharon my dad died heart attack and I d developed this hacking cough Bobby Crager dropped by my office one day and gave me a fatherly little pep talk Do you remember what those are like Yeah He had worked at Crager and Barton for eighteen months before joining the Morton Agency Get your butt in gear or get your butt out McCann laughed You know it Well to put the capper on it the doc told me I had an incipient ulcer He told me to quit smoking McCann grimaced Might as well tell me to quit breathing Morrison nodded in perfect understanding Nonsmokers could afford to be smug He looked at his own cigarette with distaste and stubbed it out knowing he would be lighting another in five minutes Did you quit He asked Yes I did At first I didn t think I d be able to I was cheating like hell Then I met a guy who told me about an outfit over on Forty-sixth Street Specialists I said what do I have to lose and went over I haven t smoked since Morrison s eyes widened What did they do Fill you full of some drug No He had taken out his wallet and was rummaging through it Here it is I knew I had one kicking around He laid a plain white business card on the bar between them QUITTERS INC Stop Going Up in Smoke East th Street Treatments by Appointment Keep it if you want McCann said They ll cure you Guaranteed How I can t tell you McCann said Huh Why not It s part of the contract they make you sign Anyway they tell you how it works when they interview you You signed a contract McCann nodded And on the basis of that Yep He smiled at Morrison who thought Well it s happened Jim McCann has joined the smug bastards Why the great secrecy if this outfit is so fantastic How come I ve never seen any spots on TV billboards magazine ads They get all the clients they can handle by word of mouth You re an advertising man Jimmy You can t believe that I do McCann said They have a ninety-eight percent cure rate Wait a second Morrison said He motioned for another drink and lit a cigarette Do these guys strap you down and make you smoke until you throw up No Give you something so that you get sick every time you light No it s nothing like that Go and see for yourself He gestured at Morrison s cigarette You don t really like that do you Nooo but Stopping really changed things for me McCann said I don t suppose it s the same for everyone but with me it was just like dominoes falling over I felt better and my relationship with Sharon improved I had more energy and my job performance picked up Look you ve got my curiosity aroused Can t you just I m sorry Dick I really can t talk about it His voice was firm Did you put on any weight For a moment he thought Jimmy McCann looked almost grim Yes A little too much in fact But I took it off again I m about right now I was skinny before Flight now boarding at Gate the loudspeaker announced That s me McCann said getting up He tossed a five on the bar Have another if you like And think about what I said Dick Really And then he was gone making his way through the crowd to the escalators Morrison picked up the card looked at it thoughtfully then tucked it away in his wallet and forgot it The card fell out of his wallet and onto another bar a month later He had left the office early and had come here to drink the afternoon away Things had not been going so well at the Morton Agency In fact things were bloody horrible He gave Henry a ten to pay for his drink then picked up the small card and reread it East Forty-sixth Street was only two blocks over it was a cool sunny October day outside and maybe just for chuckles When Henry brought his change he finished his drink and then went for a walk Quitters Inc was in a new building where the monthly rent on office space was probably close to Morrison s yearly salary From the directory in the lobby it looked to him like their offices took up one whole floor and that spelled money Lots of it He took the elevator up and stepped off into a lushly carpeted foyer and from there into a gracefully appointed reception room with a wide window that looked out on the scurrying bugs below Three men and one woman sat in the chairs along the walls reading magazines Business types all of them Morrison went to the desk A friend gave me this he said passing the card to the receptionist I guess you d say he s an alumnus She smiled and rolled a form into her typewriter What is your name sir Richard Morrison Clack-clackety-clack But very muted clacks the typewriter was an IBM Your address Twenty-nine Maple Lane Clinton New York Married Yes Children One He thought of Alvin and frowned slightly One was the wrong word A half might be better His son was mentally retarded and lived at a special school in New Jersey Who recommended us to you Mr Morrison An old school friend James McCann Very good Will you have a seat It s been a very busy day All right He sat between the woman who was wearing a severe blue suit and a young executive type wearing a herringbone jacket and modish sideburns He took out his pack of cigarettes looked around and saw there were no ashtrays He put the pack away again That was all right He would see this little game through and then light up while he was leaving He might even tap some ashes on their maroon shag rug if they made him wait long enough He picked up a copy of Time and began to leaf through it He was called a quarter of an hour later after the woman in the blue suit His nicotine center was speaking quite loudly now A man who had come in after him took out a cigarette case snapped it open saw there were no ashtrays and put it away looking a little guilty Morrison thought It made him feel better At last the receptionist gave him a sunny smile and said Go right in Mr Morrison Morrison walked through the door beyond her desk and found himself in an indirectly lit hallway A heavyset man with white hair that looked phony shook his hand smiled affably and said Follow me Mr Morrison He led Morrison past a number of closed unmarked doors and then opened one of them about halfway down the hall with a key Beyond the door was an austere little room walled with drilled white cork panels The only furnishings were a desk with a chair on either side There was what appeared to be a small oblong window in the wall behind the desk but it was covered with a short green curtain There was a picture on the wall to Morrison s left a tall man with iron-gray hair He was holding a sheet of paper in one hand He looked vaguely familiar I m Vic Donatti the heavyset man said If you decide to go ahead with our program I ll be in charge of your case Pleased to know you Morrison said He wanted a cigarette very badly Have a seat Donatti put the receptionist s form on the desk and then drew another form from the desk drawer He looked directly into Morrison s eyes Do you want to quit smoking Morrison cleared his throat crossed his legs and tried to think of a way to equivocate He couldn t Yes he said Will you sign this He gave Morrison the form He scanned it quickly The undersigned agrees not to divulge the methods or techniques or et cetera et cetera Sure he said and Donatti put a pen in his hand He scratched his name and Donatti signed below it A moment later the paper disappeared back into the desk drawer Well he thought ironically I ve taken the pledge He had taken it before Once it had lasted for two whole days Good Donatti said We don t bother with propaganda here Mr Morrison Questions of health or expense or social grace We have no interest in why you want to stop smoking We are pragmatists Good Morrison said blankly We employ no drugs We employ no Dale Carnegie people to sermonize you We recommend no special diet And we accept no payment until you have stopped smoking for one year My God Morrison said Mr McCann didn t tell you that No How is Mr McCann by the way Is he well He s fine Wonderful Excellent Now just a few questions Mr Morrison These are somewhat personal but I assure you that your answers will be held in strictest confidence Yes Morrison asked noncommittally What is your wife s name Lucinda Morrison Her maiden name was Ramsey Do you love her Morrison looked up sharply but Donatti was looking at him blandly Yes of course he said Have you ever had marital problems A separation perhaps What has that got to do with kicking the habit Morrison asked He sounded a little angrier than he had intended but he wanted hell he needed a cigarette A great deal Donatti said Just bear with me No Nothing like that Although things had been a little tense just lately You just have the one child Yes Alvin He s in a private school And which school is it That Morrison said grimly I m not going to tell you All right Donatti said agreeably He smiled disarmingly at Morrison All your questions will be answered tomorrow at your first treatment How nice Morrison said and stood One final question Donatti said You haven t had a cigarette for over an hour How do you feel Fine Morrison lied Just fine Good for you Donatti exclaimed He stepped around the desk and opened the door Enjoy them tonight After tomorrow you ll never smoke again Is that right Mr Morrison Donatti said solemnly we guarantee it He was sitting in the outer office of Quitters Inc the next day promptly at three He had spent most of the day swinging between skipping the appointment the receptionist had made for him on the way out and going in a spirit of mulish cooperation Throw your best pitch at me buster In the end something Jimmy McCann had said convinced him to keep the appointment It changed my whole life God knew his own life could do with some changing And then there was his own curiosity Before going up in the elevator he smoked a cigarette down to the filter Too damn bad if it s the last one he thought It tasted horrible The wait in the outer office was shorter this time When the receptionist told him to go in Donatti was waiting He offered his hand and smiled and to Morrison the smile looked almost predatory He began to feel a little tense and that made him want a cigarette Come with me Donatti said and led the way down to the small room He sat behind the desk again and Morrison took the other chair I m very glad you came Donatti said A great many prospective clients never show up again after the initial interview They discover they don t want to quit as badly as they thought It s going to be a pleasure to work with you on this When does the treatment start Hypnosis he was thinking It must be hypnosis Oh it already has It started when we shook hands in the hall Do you have cigarettes with you Mr Morrison Yes May I have them please Shrugging Morrison handed Donatti his pack There were only two or three left in it anyway Donatti put the pack on the desk Then smiling into Morrison s eyes he curled his right hand into a fist and began to hammer it down on the pack of cigarettes which twisted and flattened A broken cigarette end flew out Tobacco crumbs spilled The sound of Donatti s fist was very loud in the closed room The smile remained on his face in spite of the force of the blows and Morrison was chilled by it Probably just the effect they want to inspire he thought At last Donatti ceased pounding He picked up the pack a twisted and battered ruin You wouldn t believe the pleasure that gives me he said and dropped the pack into the waste-basket Even after three years in the business it still pleases me As a treatment it leaves something to be desired Morrison said mildly There s a newsstand in the lobby of this very building And they sell all brands As you say Donatti said He folded his hands Your son Alvin Dawes Morrison is in the Paterson School for Handicapped Children Born with cranial brain damage Tested IQ of Not quite in the educable retarded category Your wife How did you find that out Morrison barked He was startled and angry You ve got no goddamn right to go poking around my We know a lot about you Donatti said smoothly But as I said it will all be held in strictest confidence I m getting out of here Morrison said thinly He stood up Stay a bit longer Morrison looked at him closely Donatti wasn t upset In fact he looked a little amused The face of a man who has seen this reaction scores of times maybe hundreds All right But it better be good Oh it is Donatti leaned back I told you we were pragmatists here As pragmatists we have to start by realizing how difficult it is to cure an addiction to tobacco The relapse rate is almost eighty-five percent The relapse rate for heroin addicts is lower than that It is an extraordinary problem Extraordinary Morrison glanced into the wastebasket One of the cigarettes although twisted still looked smokeable Donatti laughed good-naturedly reached into the wastebasket and broke it between his fingers State legislatures sometimes hear a request that the prison systems do away with the weekly cigarette ration Such proposals are invariably defeated In a few cases where they have passed there have been fierce prison riots Riots Mr Morrison Imagine it I Morrison said am not surprised But consider the implications When you put a man in prison you take away any normal sex life you take away his liquor his politics his freedom of movement No riots or few in comparison to the number of prisons But when you take away his cigarettes wham bam He slammed his fist on the desk for emphasis During World War I when no one on the German home front could get cigarettes the sight of German aristocrats picking butts out of the gutter was a common one During World War II many American women turned to pipes when they were unable to obtain cigarettes A fascinating problem for the true pragmatist Mr Morrison Could we get to the treatment Momentarily Step over here please Donatti had risen and was standing by the green curtains Morrison had noticed yesterday Donatti drew the curtains discovering a rectangular window that looked into a bare room No not quite bare There was a rabbit on the floor eating pellets out of a dish Pretty bunny Morrison commented Indeed Watch him Donatti pressed a button by the windowsill The rabbit stopped eating and began to hop about crazily It seemed to leap higher each time its feet struck the floor Its fur stood out spikily in all directions Its eyes were wild Stop that You re electrocuting him Donatti released the button Far from it There s a very low-yield charge in the floor Watch the rabbit Mr Morrison The rabbit was crouched about ten feet away from the dish of pellets His nose wriggled All at once he hopped away into a corner If the rabbit gets a jolt often enough while he s eating Donatti said he makes the association very quickly Eating causes pain Therefore he won t eat A few more shocks and the rabbit will starve to death in front of his food It s called aversion training Light dawned in Morrison s head No thanks He started for the door Wait please Mr Morrison Morrison didn t pause He grasped the doorknob and felt it slip solidly through his hand Unlock this Mr Morrison if you ll just sit down Unlock this door or I ll have the cops on you before you can say Marlboro Man Sit down The voice was as cold as shaved ice Morrison looked at Donatti His brown eyes were muddy and frightening My God he thought I m locked in here with a psycho He licked his lips He wanted a cigarette more than he ever had in his life Let me explain the treatment in more detail Donatti said You don t understand Morrison said with counterfeit patience I don t want the treatment I ve decided against it No Mr Morrison You re the one who doesn t understand You don t have any choice When I told you the treatment had already begun I was speaking the literal truth I would have thought you d tipped to that by now You re crazy Morrison said wonderingly No Only a pragmatist Let me tell you all about the treatment Sure Morrison said As long as you understand that as soon as I get out of here I m going to buy five packs of cigarettes and smoke them all on the way to the police station He suddenly realized he was biting his thumbnail sucking on it and made himself stop As you wish But I think you ll change your mind when you see the whole picture Morrison said nothing He sat down again and folded his hands For the first month of the treatment our operatives will have you under constant supervision Donatti said You ll be able to spot some of them Not all But they ll always be with you Always If they see you smoke a cigarette I get a call And I suppose you bring me here and do the old rabbit trick Morrison said He tried to sound cold and sarcastic but he suddenly felt horribly frightened This was a nightmare Oh no Donatti said Your wife gets the rabbit trick not you Morrison looked at him dumbly Donatti smiled You he said get to watch After Donatti let him out Morrison walked for over two hours in a complete daze It was another fine day but he didn t notice The monstrousness of Donatti s smiling face blotted out all else You see he had said a pragmatic problem demands pragmatic solutions You must realize we have your best interests at heart Quitters Inc according to Donatti was a sort of foundation a nonprofit organization begun by the man in the wall portrait The gentleman had been extremely successful in several family businesses including slot machines massage parlors numbers and a brisk although clandestine trade between New York and Turkey Mort Three-Fingers Minelli had been a heavy smoker up in the three-pack-a-day range The paper he was holding in the picture was a doctor s diagnosis lung cancer Mort had died in after endowing Quitters Inc with family funds We try to keep as close to breaking even as possible Donatti had said But we re more interested in helping our fellow man And of course it s a great tax angle The treatment was chillingly simple A first offense and Cindy would be brought to what Donatti called the rabbit room A second offense and Morrison would get the dose On a third offense both of them would be brought in together A fourth offense would show grave cooperation problems and would require sterner measures An operative would be sent to Alvin s school to work the boy over Imagine Donatti said smiling how horrible it will be for the boy He wouldn t understand it even if someone explained He ll only know someone is hurting him because Daddy was bad He ll be very frightened You bastard Morrison said helplessly He felt close to tears You dirty filthy bastard Don t misunderstand Donatti said He was smiling sympathetically I m sure it won t happen Forty percent of our clients never have to be disciplined at all and only ten percent have more than three falls from grace Those are reassuring figures aren t they Morrison didn t find them reassuring He found them terrifying Of course if you transgress a fifth time What do you mean Donatti beamed The room for you and your wife a second beating for your son and a beating for your wife Morrison driven beyond the point of rational consideration lunged over the desk at Donatti Donatti moved with amazing speed for a man who had apparently been completely relaxed He shoved the chair backward and drove both of his feet over the desk and into Morrison s belly Gagging and coughing Morrison staggered backward Sit down Mr Morrison Donatti said benignly Let s talk this over like rational men When he could get his breath Morrison did as he was told Nightmares had to end sometime didn t they Quitters Inc Donatti had explained further operated on a ten-step punishment scale Steps six seven and eight consisted of further trips to the rabbit room and increased voltage and more serious beatings The ninth step would be the breaking of his son s arms And the tenth Morrison asked his mouth dry Donatti shook his head sadly Then we give up Mr Morrison You become part of the unregenerate two percent You really give up In a manner of speaking He opened one of the desk drawers and laid a silenced on the desk He smiled into Morrison s eyes But even the unregenerate two percent never smoke again We guarantee it The Friday Night Movie was Bullitt one of Cindy s favorites but after an hour of Morrison s mutterings and fidgetings her concentration was broken What s the matter with you she asked during station identification Nothing everything he growled I m giving up smoking She laughed Since when Five minutes ago Since three o clock this afternoon You really haven t had a cigarette since then No he said and began to gnaw his thumbnail It was ragged down to the quick That s wonderful What ever made you decide to quit You he said And and Alvin Her eyes widened and when the movie came back on she didn t notice Dick rarely mentioned their retarded son She came over looked at the empty ashtray by his right hand and then into his eyes Are you really trying to quit Dick Really And if I go to the cops he added mentally the local goon squad will be around to rearrange your face Cindy I m glad Even if you don t make it we both thank you for the thought Dick Oh I think I ll make it he said thinking of the muddy homicidal look that had come into Donatti s eyes when he kicked him in the stomach He slept badly that night dozing in and out of sleep Around three o clock he woke up completely His craving for a cigarette was like a low-grade fever He went downstairs and to his study The room was in the middle of the house No windows He slid open the top drawer of his desk and looked in fascinated by the cigarette box He looked around and licked his lips Constant supervision during the first month Donatti had said Eighteen hours a day during the next two but he would never know which eighteen During the fourth month the month when most clients backslid the service would return to twenty-four hours a day Then twelve hours of broken surveillance each day for the rest of the year After that Random surveillance for the rest of the client s life For the rest of his life We may audit you every other month Donatti said Or every other day Or constantly for one week two years from now The point is you won t know If you smoke you ll be gambling with loaded dice Are they watching Are they picking up my wife or sending a man after my son right now Beautiful isn t it And if you do sneak a smoke it ll taste awful It will taste like your son s blood But they couldn t be watching now in the dead of night in his own study The house was grave-quiet He looked at the cigarettes in the box for almost two minutes unable to tear his gaze away Then he went to the study door peered out into the empty hall and went back to look at the cigarettes some more A horrible picture came his life stretching before him and not a cigarette to be found How in the name of God was he ever going to be able to make another tough presentation to a wary client without that cigarette burning nonchalantly between his fingers as he approached the charts and layouts How would he be able to endure Cindy s endless garden shows without a cigarette How could he even get up in the morning and face the day without a cigarette to smoke as he drank his coffee and read the paper He cursed himself for getting into this He cursed Donatti And most of all he cursed Jimmy McCann How could he have done it The son of a bitch had known His hands trembled in their desire to get hold of Jimmy Judas McCann Stealthily he glanced around the study again He reached into the drawer and brought out a cigarette He caressed it fondled it What was that old slogan So round so firm so fully packed Truer words had never been spoken He put the cigarette in his mouth and then paused cocking his head Had there been the slightest noise from the closet A faint shifting Surely not But Another mental image that rabbit hopping crazily in the grip of electricity The thought of Cindy in that room He listened desperately and heard nothing He told himself that all he had to do was go to the closet door and yank it open But he was too afraid of what he might find He went back to bed but didn t sleep for a long time In spite of how lousy he felt in the morning breakfast tasted good After a moment s hesitation he followed his customary bowl of cornflakes with scrambled eggs He was grumpily washing out the pan when Cindy came downstairs in her robe Richard Morrison You haven t eaten an egg for breakfast since Hector was a pup Morrison grunted He considered since Hector was a pup to be one of Cindy s stupider sayings on a par with I should smile and kiss a pig Have you smoked yet she asked pouring orange juice No You ll be back on them by noon she proclaimed airily Lot of goddamn help you are he rasped rounding on her You and anyone else who doesn t smoke you all think ah never mind He expected her to be angry but she was looking at him with something like wonder You re really serious she said You really are You bet I am You ll never know how serious I hope Poor baby she said going to him You look like death warmed over But I m very proud Morrison held her tightly Scenes from the life of Richard Morrison October-November Morrison and a crony from Larkin Studios at Jack Dempsey s bar Crony offers a cigarette Morrison grips his glass a little more tightly and says I m quitting Crony laughs and says I give you a week Morrison waiting for the morning train looking over the top of the Times at a young man in a blue suit He sees the young man almost every morning now and sometimes at other places At Onde s where he is meeting a client Looking at s in Sam Goody s where Morrison is looking for a Sam Cooke album Once in a foursome behind Morrison s group at the local golf course Morrison getting drunk at a party wanting a cigarette but not quite drunk enough to take one Morrison visiting his son bringing him a large ball that squeaked when you squeezed it His son s slobbering delighted kiss Somehow not as repulsive as before Hugging his son tightly realizing what Donatti and his colleagues had so cynically realized before him love is the most pernicious drug of all Let the romantics debate its existence Pragmatists accept it and use it Morrison losing the physical compulsion to smoke little by little but never quite losing the psychological craving or the need to have something in his mouth cough drops Life Savers a toothpick Poor substitutes all of them And finally Morrison hung up in a colossal traffic jam in the Midtown Tunnel Darkness Horns blaring Air stinking Traffic hopelessly snarled And suddenly thumbing open the glove compartment and seeing the half-open pack of cigarettes in there He looked at them for a moment then snatched one and lit it with the dashboard lighter If anything happens it s Cindy s fault he told himself defiantly I told her to get rid of all the damn cigarettes The first drag made him cough smoke out furiously The second made his eyes water The third made him feel lightheaded and swoony It tastes awful he thought And on the heels of that My God what am I doing Horns blatted impatiently behind him Ahead the traffic had begun to move again He stubbed the cigarette out in the ashtray opened both front windows opened the vents and then fanned the air helplessly like a kid who has just flushed his first butt down the john He joined the traffic flow jerkily and drove home Cindy he called I m home No answer Cindy Where are you hon The phone rang and he pounced on it Hello Cindy Hello Mr Morrison Donatti said He sounded pleasantly brisk and businesslike It seems we have a small business matter to attend to Would five o clock be convenient Have you got my wife Yes indeed Donatti chuckled indulgently Look let her go Morrison babbled It won t happen again It was a slip just a slip that s all I only had three drags and for God s sake it didn t even taste good That s a shame I ll count on you for five then shall I Please Morrison said close to tears Please He was speaking to a dead line At p m the reception room was empty except for the secretary who gave him a twinkly smile that ignored Morrison s pallor and disheveled appearance Mr Donatti she said into the intercom Mr Morrison to see you She nodded to Morrison Go right in Donatti was waiting outside the unmarked room with a man who was wearing a SMILE sweatshirt and carrying a He was built like an ape Listen Morrison said to Donatti We can work something out can t we I ll pay you I ll Shaddap the man in the SMILE sweatshirt said It s good to see you Donatti said Sorry it has to be under such adverse circumstances Will you come with me We ll make this as brief as possible I can assure you your wife won t be hurt this time Morrison tensed himself to leap at Donatti Come come Donatti said looking annoyed If you do that Junk here is going to pistol-whip you and your wife is still going to get it Now where s the percentage in that I hope you rot in hell he told Donatti Donatti sighed If I had a nickel for every time someone expressed a similar sentiment I could retire Let it be a lesson to you Mr Morrison When a romantic tries to do a good thing and fails they give him a medal When a pragmatist succeeds they wish him in hell Shall we go Junk motioned with the pistol Morrison preceded them into the room He felt numb The small green curtain had been pulled Junk prodded him with the gun This is what being a witness at the gas chamber must have been like he thought He looked in Cindy was there looking around bewilderedly Cindy Morrison called miserably Cindy they She can t hear or see you Donatti said One-way glass Well let s get it over with It really was a very small slip I believe thirty seconds should be enough Junk Junk pressed the button with one hand and kept the pistol jammed firmly into Morrison s back with the other It was the longest thirty seconds of his life When it was over Donatti put a hand on Morrison s shoulder and said Are you going to throw up No Morrison said weakly His forehead was against the glass His legs were jelly I don t think so He turned around and saw that Junk was gone Come with me Donatti said Where Morrison asked apathetically I think you have a few things to explain don t you How can I face her How can I tell her that I I I think you re going to be surprised Donatti said The room was empty except for a sofa Cindy was on it sobbing helplessly Cindy he said gently She looked up her eyes magnified by tears Dick she whispered Dick Oh Oh God He held her tightly Two men she said against his chest In the house and at first I thought they were burglars and then I thought they were going to rape me and then they took me someplace with a blindfold over my eyes and and oh it was h-horrible Shhh he said Shhh But why she asked looking up at him Why would they Because of me he said I have to tell you a story Cindy When he had finished he was silent a moment and then said I suppose you hate me I wouldn t blame you He was looking at the floor and she took his face in both hands and turned it to hers No she said I don t hate you He looked at her in mute surprise It was worth it she said God bless these people They ve let you out of prison Do you mean that Yes she said and kissed him Can we go home now I feel much better Ever so much The phone rang one evening a week later and when Morrison recognized Donatti s voice he said Your boys have got it wrong I haven t even been near a cigarette We know that We have a final matter to talk over Can you stop by tomorrow afternoon Is it No nothing serious Bookkeeping really By the way congratulations on your promotion How did you know about that We re keeping tabs Donatti said noncommittally and hung up When they entered the small room Donatti said Don t look so nervous No one s going to bite you Step over here please Morrison saw an ordinary bathroom scale Listen I ve gained a little weight but Yes seventy-three percent of our clients do Step up please Morrison did and tipped the scales at one seventy-four Okay fine You can step off How tall are you Mr Morrison Five-eleven Okay let s see He pulled a small card laminated in plastic from his breast pocket Well that s not too bad I m going to write you a prescrip for some highly illegal diet pills Use them sparingly and according to directions And I m going to set your maximum weight at let s see He consulted the card again One eighty-two how does that sound And since this is December first I ll expect you the first of every month for a weigh-in No problem if you can t make it as long as you call in advance And what happens if I go over one-eighty-two Donatti smiled We ll send someone out to your house to cut off your wife s little finger he said You can leave through this door Mr Morrison Have a nice day Eight months later Morrison runs into the crony from the Larkin Studios at Dempsey s bar Morrison is down to what Cindy proudly calls his fighting weight one sixty-seven He works out three times a week and looks as fit as whipcord The crony from Larkin by comparison looks like something the cat dragged in Crony Lord how d you ever stop I m locked into this damn habit tighter than Tillie The crony stubs his cigarette out with real revulsion and drains his scotch Morrison looks at him speculatively and then takes a small white business card out of his wallet He puts it on the bar between them You know he says these guys changed my life Twelve months later Morrison receives a bill in the mail The bill says QUITTERS INC East th Street New York N Y Treatment Counselor Victor Donatti Electricity total Please pay this amount Those sons of bitches he explodes They charged me for the electricity they used to to Just pay it she says and kisses him Twenty months later Quite by accident Morrison and his wife meet the Jimmy McCanns at the Helen Hayes Theatre Introductions are made all around Jimmy looks as good if not better than he did on that day in the airport terminal so long ago Morrison has never met his wife She is pretty in the radiant way plain girls sometimes have when they are very very happy She offers her hand and Morrison shakes it There is something odd about her grip and halfway through the second act he realizes what it was The little finger on her right hand is missing I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED I know what you need Elizabeth looked up from her sociology text startled and saw a rather nondescript young man in a green fatigue jacket For a moment she thought he looked familiar as if she had known him before the feeling was close to deja vu Then it was gone He was about her height skinny and twitchy That was the word He wasn t moving but he seemed to be twitching inside his skin just out of sight His hair was black and unkempt He wore thick horn-rimmed glasses that magnified his dark brown eyes and the lenses looked dirty No she was quite sure she had never seen him before You know she said I doubt that You need a strawberry double-dip cone Right She blinked at him frankly startled Somewhere in the back of her mind she had been thinking about breaking for an ice cream She was studying for finals in one of the third- floor carrels of the Student Union and there was still a woefully long way to go Right he persisted and smiled It transformed his face from something over-intense and nearly ugly into something else that was oddly appealing The word cute occurred to her and that wasn t a good word to afflict a boy with but this one was when he smiled She smiled back before she could road block it behind her lips This she didn t need to have to waste time brushing off some weirdo who had decided to pick the worst time of the year to try to make an impression She still had sixteen chapters of Introduction to Sociology to wade through No thanks she said Come on if you hit them any harder you ll give yourself a headache You ve been at it two hours without a break How would you know that I ve been watching you he said promptly but this time his gamin grin was lost on her She already had a headache Well you can stop she said more sharply than she had intended I don t like people staring at me I m sorry She felt a little sorry for him the way she sometimes felt sorry for stray dogs He seemed to float in the green fatigue jacket and yes he had on mismatched socks One black one brown She felt herself getting ready to smile again and held it back I ve got these finals she said gently Sure he said Okay She looked after him for a moment pensively Then she lowered her gaze to her book but an afterimage of the encounter remained strawberry double-dip When she got back to the dorm it was p m and Alice was stretched out on her bed listening to Neil Diamond and reading The Story of O I didn t know they assigned that in Eh- Elizabeth said Alice sat up Broadening my horizons darling Spreading my intellectual wings Raising my Liz Hmmm Did you hear what I said No sorry I You look like somebody conked you one kid I met a guy tonight Sort of a funny guy at that Oh He must be something if he can separate the great Rogan from her beloved texts His name is Edward Jackson Hamner Junior no less Short Skinny Looks like he washed his hair last around Washington s birthday Oh and mismatched socks One black one brown I thought you were more the fraternity type It s nothing like that Alice I was studying at the Union on the third floor the Think Tank and he invited me down to the Grinder for an ice-cream cone I told him no and he sort of slunk off But once he started me thinking about ice cream I couldn t stop I d just decided to give up and take a break and there he was holding a big drippy strawberry double-dip in each hand I tremble to hear the denouement Elizabeth snorted Well I couldn t really say no So he sat down and it turns out he had sociology with Professor Branner last year Will wonders never cease lawd a mercy Goshen to Christmas Listen this is really amazing You know the way I ve been sweating that course Yes You talk about it in your sleep practically I ve got a seventy-eight average I ve got to have an eighty to keep my scholarship and that means I need at least an eighty-four on the final Well this Ed Hamner says Branner uses almost the same final every year And Ed s eidetic You mean he s got a whatzit photographic memory Yes Look at this She opened her sociology book and took out three sheets of notebook paper covered with writing Alice took them This looks like multiple-choice stuff It is Ed says it s Branner s last year s final word for word Alice said flatly I don t believe it But it covers all the material Still don t believe it She handed the sheets back Just because this spook He isn t a spook Don t call him that Okay This little guy hasn t got you bamboozled into just memorizing this and not studying at all has he Of course not she said uneasily And even if this is like the exam do you think it s exactly ethical Anger surprised her and ran away with her tongue before she could hold it That s great for you sure Dean s List every semester and your folks paying your way You aren t Hey I m sorry There was no call for that Alice shrugged and opened again her face carefully neutral No you re right Not my business But why don t you study the book too just to be safe Of course I will But mostly she studied the exam notes provided by Edward Jackson Hamner Jr When she came out of the lecture hall after the exam he was sitting in the lobby floating in his green army fatigue coat He smiled tentatively at her and stood up How d it go Impulsively she kissed his cheek She could not remember such a blessed feeling of relief I think I aced it Really That s great Like a burger Love one she said absently Her mind was still on the exam It was the one Ed had given her almost word for word and she had sailed through Over hamburgers she asked him how his own finals were going Don t have any I m in Honors and you don t take them unless you want to I was doing okay so I didn t Then why are you still here I had to see how you did didn t I Ed you didn t That s sweet but The naked look in his eyes troubled her She had seen it before She was a pretty girl Yes he said softly Yes I did Ed I m grateful I think you saved my scholarship I really do But I have a boyfriend you know Serious he asked with a poor attempt to speak lightly Very she said matching his tone Almost engaged Does he know he s lucky Does he know how lucky I m lucky too she said thinking of Tony Lombard Beth he said suddenly What she asked startled Nobody calls you that do they Why no No they don t Not even this guy No Tony called her Liz Sometimes Lizzie which was even worse He leaned forward But Beth is what you like best isn t it She laughed to cover her confusion Whatever in the world Never mind He grinned his gamin grin I ll call you Beth That s better Now eat your hamburger Then her junior year was over and she was saying goodbye to Alice They were a little stiff together and Elizabeth was sorry She supposed it was her own fault she had crowed a little loudly about her sociology final when grades were posted She had scored a ninety- seven highest in the division Well she told herself as she waited at the airport for her flight to be called it wasn t any more unethical than the cramming she had been resigned to in that third-floor carrel Cramming wasn t real studying at all just rote memorization that faded away to nothing as soon as the exam was over She fingered the envelope that poked out of her purse Notice of her scholarship-loan package for her senior year two thousand dollars She and Tony would be working together in Boothbay Maine this summer and the money she would earn there would put her over the top And thanks to Ed Hamner it was going to be a beautiful summer Clear sailing all the way But it was the most miserable summer of her life June was rainy the gas shortage depressed the tourist trade and her tips at the Boothbay Inn were mediocre Even worse Tony was pressing her on the subject of marriage He could get a job on or near campus he said and with her Student Aid grant she could get her degree in style She was surprised to find that the idea scared rather than pleased her Something was wrong She didn t know what but something was missing out of whack out of kilter One night late in July she frightened herself by going on a hysterical crying jag in her apartment The only good thing about it was that her roommate a mousy little girl named Sandra Ackerman was out on a date The nightmare came in early August She was lying in the bottom of an open grave unable to move Rain fell from a white sky onto her upturned face Then Tony was standing over her wearing his yellow high-impact construction helmet Marry me Liz he said looking down at her expressionlessly Marry me or else She tried to speak to agree she would do anything if only he would take her out of this dreadful muddy hole But she was paralyzed All right he said It s or else then He went away She struggled to break out of her paralysis and couldn t Then she heard the bulldozer A moment later she saw it a high yellow monster pushing a mound of wet earth in front of the blade Tony s merciless face looked down from the open cab He was going to bury her alive Trapped in her motionless voiceless body she could only watch in dumb horror Trickles of dirt began to run down the sides of the hole A familiar voice cried Go Leave her now Go Tony stumbled down from the bulldozer and ran Huge relief swept her She would have cried had she been able And her savior appeared standing at the foot of the open grave like a sexton It was Ed Hamner floating in his green fatigue jacket his hair awry his horn-rims slipped down to the small bulge at the end of his nose He held his hand out to her Get up he said gently I know what you need Get up Beth And she could get up She sobbed with relief She tried to thank him her words spilled out on top of each other And Ed only smiled gently and nodded She took his hand and looked down to see her footing And when she looked up again she was holding the paw of a huge slavering timber wolf with red hurricane-lantern eyes and thick spiked teeth open to bite She woke up sitting bolt upright in bed her nightgown drenched with sweat Her body was shaking uncontrollably And even after a warm shower and a glass of milk she could not reconcile herself to the dark She slept with the light on A week later Tony was dead She opened the door in her robe expecting to see Tony but it was Danny Kilmer one of the fellows he worked with Danny was a fun guy she and Tony had doubled with him and his girl a couple of times But standing in the doorway of her second-floor apartment Danny looked not only serious but ill Danny she said What Liz he said Liz you ve got to hold onto yourself You ve ah God He pounded the jamb of the door with one big-knuckled dirty hand and she saw he was crying Danny is it Tony Is something Tony s dead Danny said He was But he was talking to air She had fainted The next week passed in a kind of dream The story pieced itself together from the woefully brief newspaper account and from what Danny told her over a beer in the Harbor Inn They had been repairing drainage culverts on Route Part of the road was torn up and Tony was flagging traffic A kid driving a red Fiat had been coming down the hill Tony had flagged him but the kid never even slowed Tony had been standing next to a dump truck and there was no place to jump back The kid in the Fiat had sustained head lacerations and a broken arm he was hysterical and also cold sober The police found several holes in his brake lines as if they had overheated and then melted through His driving record was A-l he had simply been unable to stop Her Tony had been a victim of that rarest of automobile mishaps an honest accident Her shock and depression were increased by guilt The fates had taken out of her hands the decision on what to do about Tony And a sick secret part of her was glad it was so Because she hadn t wanted to marry Tony not since the night of her dream She broke down the day before she went home She was sitting on a rock outcropping by herself and after an hour or so the tears came They surprised her with their fury She cried until her stomach hurt and her head ached and when the tears passed she felt not better but at least drained and empty And that was when Ed Hamner said Beth She jerked around her mouth filled with the copper taste of fear half expecting to see the snarling wolf of her dream But it was only Ed Hamner looking sunburned and strangely defenseless without his fatigue jacket and blue jeans He was wearing red shorts that stopped just ahead of his bony knees a white T-shirt that billowed on his thin chest like a loose sail in the ocean breeze and rubber thongs He wasn t smiling and the fierce sun glitter on his glasses made it impossible to see his eyes Ed she said tentatively half convinced that this was some grief-induced hallucination Is that really Yes it s me How I ve been working at the Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan I ran into your roommate Alice is that her name Yes She told me what happened I came right away Poor Beth He moved his head only a degree or so but the sun glare slid off his glasses and she saw nothing wolfish nothing predatory but only a calm warm sympathy She began to weep again and staggered a little with the unexpected force of it Then he was holding her and then it was all right They had dinner at the Silent Woman in Waterville which was twenty-five miles away maybe exactly the distance she needed They went in Ed s car a new Corvette and he drove well neither showily nor fussily as she guessed he might She didn t want to talk and she didn t want to be cheered up He seemed to know it and played quiet music on the radio And he ordered without consulting her seafood She thought she wasn t hungry but when the food came she fell to ravenously When she looked up again her plate was empty and she laughed nervously Ed was smoking a cigarette and watching her The grieving damsel ate a hearty meal she said You must think I m awful No he said You ve been through a lot and you need to get your strength back It s like being sick isn t it Yes Just like that He took her hand across the table squeezed it briefly then let it go But now it s recuperation time Beth Is it Is it really Yes he said So tell me What are your plans I m going home tomorrow After that I don t know You re going back to school aren t you I just don t know After this it seems so so trivial A lot of the purpose seems to have gone out of it And all the fun It ll come back That s hard for you to believe now but it s true Try it for six weeks and see You ve got nothing better to do The last seemed a question That s true I guess But Can I have a cigarette Sure They re menthol though Sorry She took one How did you know I didn t like menthol cigarettes He shrugged You just don t look like one of those I guess She smiled You re funny do you know that He smiled neutrally No really For you of all people to turn up I thought I didn t want to see anyone But I m really glad it was you Ed Sometimes it s nice to be with someone you re not involved with That s it I guess She paused Who are you Ed besides my fairy godfather Who are you really It was suddenly important to her that she know He shrugged Nobody much Just one of the sort of funny-looking guys you see creeping around campus with a load of books under one arm Ed you re not funny-looking Sure I am he said and smiled Never grew all the way out of my high-school acne never got rushed by a big frat never made any kind of splash in the social whirl Just a dorm rat making grades that s all When the big corporations interview on campus next spring I ll probably sign on with one of them and Ed Hamner will disappear forever That would be a great shame she said softly He smiled and it was a very peculiar smile Almost bitter What about your folks she asked Where you live what you like to do Another time he said I want to get you back You ve got a long plane ride tomorrow and a lot of hassles The evening left her relaxed for the first time since Tony s death without that feeling that somewhere inside a mainspring was being wound and wound to the breaking point She thought sleep would come easily but it did not Little questions nagged Alice told me poor Beth But Alice was summering in Kittery eighty miles from Skowhegan She must have been at Lakewood for a play The Corvette this year s model Expensive A backstage job at Lakewood hadn t paid for that Were his parents rich He had ordered just what she would have ordered herself Maybe the only thing on the menu she would have eaten enough of to discover that she was hungry The menthol cigarettes the way he had kissed her good night exactly as she had wanted to be kissed And You Ve got a long plane ride tomorrow He knew she was going home because she had told him But how had he known she was going by plane Or that it was a long ride It bothered her It bothered her because she was halfway to being in love with Ed Hamner I know what you need Like the voice of a submarine captain tolling off fathoms the words he had greeted her with followed her down to sleep He didn t come to the tiny Augusta airport to see her off and waiting for the plane she was surprised by her own disappointment She was thinking about how quietly you could grow to depend on a person almost like a junkie with a habit The hype fools himself that he can take this stuff or leave it when really Elizabeth Rogan the PA blared Please pick up the white courtesy phone She hurried to it And Ed s voice said Beth Ed It s good to hear you I thought maybe That I d meet you He laughed You don t need me for that You re a big strong girl Beautiful too You can handle this Will I see you at school I yes I think so Good There was a moment of silence Then he said Because I love you I have from the first time I saw you Her tongue was locked She couldn t speak A thousand thoughts whirled through her mind He laughed again gently No don t say anything Not now I ll see you There ll be time then All the time in the world Good trip Beth Goodbye And he was gone leaving her with a white phone in her hand and her own chaotic thoughts and questions September Elizabeth picked up the old pattern of school and classes like a woman who has been interrupted at knitting She was rooming with Alice again of course they had been roomies since freshman year when they had been thrown together by the housing- department computer They had always gotten along well despite differing interests and personalities Alice was the studious one a chemistry major with a average Elizabeth was more social less bookish with a split major in education and math They still got on well but a faint coolness seemed to have grown up between them over the summer Elizabeth chalked it up to the difference of opinion over the sociology final and didn t mention it The events of the summer began to seem dreamlike In a funny way it sometimes seemed that Tony might have been a boy she had known in high school It still hurt to think about him and she avoided the subject with Alice but the hurt was an old-bruise throb and not the bright pain of an open wound What hurt more was Ed Hamner s failure to call A week passed then two then it was October She got a student directory from the Union and looked up his name It was no help after his name were only the words Mill St And Mill was a very long street indeed And so she waited and when she was called for dates which was often she turned them down Alice raised her eyebrows but said nothing she was buried alive in a six-week biochem project and spent most of her evenings at the library Elizabeth noticed the long white envelopes that her roommate was receiving once or twice a week in the mail since she was usually back from class first but thought nothing of them The private detective agency was discreet it did not print its return address on its envelopes When the intercom buzzed Alice was studying You get it Liz Probably for you anyway Elizabeth went to the intercom Yes Gentleman door-caller Liz Oh Lord Who is it she asked annoyed and ran through her tattered stack of excuses Migraine headache She hadn t used that one this week The desk girl said amused His name is Edward Jackson Hamner Junior no less Her voice lowered His socks don t match Elizabeth s hand flew to the collar of her robe Oh God Tell him I ll be right down No tell him it will be just a minute No a couple of minutes okay Sure the voice said dubiously Don t have a hemorrhage Elizabeth took a pair of slacks out of her closet Took out a short denim skirt Felt the curlers in her hair and groaned Began to yank them out Alice watched all this calmly without speaking but she looked speculatively at the door for a long time after Elizabeth had left He looked just the same he hadn t changed at all He was wearing his green fatigue jacket and it still looked at least two sizes too big One of the bows of his horn-rimmed glasses had been mended with electrician s tape His jeans looked new and stiff miles from the soft and faded in look that Tony had achieved effortlessly He was wearing one green sock one brown sock And she knew she loved him Why didn t you call before she asked going to him He stuck his hands in the pockets of his jacket and grinned shyly I thought I d give you some time to date around Meet some guys Figure out what you want I think I know that Good Would you like to go to a movie Anything she said Anything at all As the days passed it occurred to her that she had never met anyone male or female that seemed to understand her moods and needs so completely or so wordlessly Their tastes coincided While Tony had enjoyed violent movies of the Godfather type Ed seemed more into comedy or nonviolent dramas He took her to the circus one night when she was feeling low and they had a hilariously wonderful time Study dates were real study dates not just an excuse to grope on the third floor of the Union He took her to dances and seemed especially good at the old ones which she loved They won a fifties Stroll trophy at a Homecoming Nostalgia Dance More important he seemed to understand when she wanted to be passionate He didn t force her or hurry her she never got the feeling that she had with some of the other boys she had gone out with that there was an inner timetable for sex beginning with a kiss good night on Date and ending with a night in some friend s borrowed apartment on Date The Mill Street apartment was Ed s exclusively a third-floor walk-up They went there often and Elizabeth went without the feeling that she was walking into some minor-league Don Juan s passion pit He didn t push He honestly seemed to want what she wanted when she wanted it And things progressed When school reconvened following the semester break Alice seemed strangely preoccupied Several times that afternoon before Ed came to pick her up they were going out to dinner Elizabeth looked up to see her roommate frowning down at a large manila envelope on her desk Once Elizabeth almost asked about it then decided not to Some new project probably It was snowing hard when Ed brought her back to the dorm Tomorrow he asked My place Sure I ll make some popcorn Great he said and kissed her I love you Beth Love you too Would you like to stay over Ed asked evenly Tomorrow night All right Ed She looked into his eyes Whatever you want Good he said quietly Sleep well kid You too She expected that Alice would be asleep and entered the room quietly but Alice was up and sitting at her desk Alice are you okay I have to talk to you Liz About Ed What about him Alice said carefully I think that when I finish talking to you we re not going to be friends anymore For me that s giving up a lot So I want you to listen carefully Then maybe you better not say anything I have to try Elizabeth felt her initial curiosity kindle into anger Have you been snooping around Ed Alice only looked at her Were you jealous of us No If I d been jealous of you and your dates I would have moved out two years ago Elizabeth looked at her perplexed She knew what Alice said was the truth And she suddenly felt afraid Two things made me wonder about Ed Hamner Alice said First you wrote me about Tony s death and said how lucky it was that I d seen Ed at the Lakewood Theater how he came right over to Boothbay and really helped you out But I never saw him Liz I was never near the Lakewood Theater last summer But But how did he know Tony was dead I have no idea I only know he didn t get it from me The other thing was that eidetic-memory business My God Liz he can t even remember which socks he s got on That s a different thing altogether Liz said stiffly It Ed Hamner was in Las Vegas last summer Alice said softly He came back in mid- July and took a motel room in Pemaquid That s just across the Boothbay Harbor town line Almost as if he were waiting for you to need him That s crazy And how would you know Ed was in Las Vegas I ran into Shirley D Antonio just before school started She worked in the Pines Restaurant which is just across from the playhouse She said she never saw anybody who looked like Ed Hamner So I ve known he s been lying to you about several things And so I went to my father and laid it out and he gave me the go-ahead To do what Elizabeth asked bewildered To hire a private detective agency Elizabeth was on her feet No more Alice That s it She would catch the bus into town spend tonight at Ed s apartment She had only been waiting for him to ask her anyway At least know Alice said Then make your own decision I don t have to know anything except he s kind and good and Love is blind huh Alice said and smiled bitterly Well maybe I happen to love you a little Liz Have you ever thought of that Elizabeth turned and looked at her for a long moment If you do you ve got a funny way of showing it she said Go on then Maybe you re right Maybe I owe you that much Go on You knew him a long time ago Alice said quietly I what P S Bridgeport Connecticut Elizabeth was struck dumb She and her parents had lived in Bridgeport for six years moving to their present home the year after she had finished the second grade She had gone to P S but Alice are you sure Do you remember him No of course not But she did remember the feeling she d had the first time she had seen Ed the feeling of deja vu The pretty ones never remember the ugly ducklings I guess Maybe he had a crush on you You were in the first grade with him Liz Maybe he sat in the back of the room and just watched you Or on the playground Just a little nothing kid who already wore glasses and probably braces and you couldn t even remember him but I ll bet he remembers you Elizabeth said What else The agency traced him from school fingerprints After that it was just a matter of finding people and talking to them The operative assigned to the case said he couldn t understand some of what he was getting Neither do I Some of it s scary It better be Elizabeth said grimly Ed Hamner Sr was a compulsive gambler He worked for a top-line advertising agency in New York and then moved to Bridgeport sort of on the run The operative says that almost every big-money poker game and high-priced book in the city was holding his markers Elizabeth closed her eyes These people really saw you got a full measure of dirt for your dollar didn t they Maybe Anyway Ed s father got in another jam in Bridgeport It was gambling again but this time he got mixed up with a big-time loan shark He got a broken leg and a broken arm somehow The operative says he doubts it was an accident Anything else Elizabeth asked Child beating Embezzlement He landed a job with a two-bit Los Angeles ad agency in That was a little too close to Las Vegas He started to spend his weekends there gambling heavily and losing Then he started taking Ed Junior with him And he started to win You re making all of this up You must be Alice tapped the report in front of her It s all here Liz Some of it wouldn t stand up in court but the operative says none of the people he talked with would have a reason to lie Ed s father called Ed his good luck charm At first nobody objected to the boy even though it was illegal for him to be in the casinos His father was a prize fish But then the father started sticking just to roulette playing only odd-even and red-black By the end of the year the boy was off-limits in every casino on the strip And his father took up a new kind of gambling What The stock market When the Hamners moved to L A in the middle of they were living in a ninety-dollar-a-month cheese box and Mr Hamner was driving a Chevrolet At the end of just sixteen months later he had quit his job and they were living in their own home in San Jose Mr Hamner was driving a brand-new Thunderbird and Mrs Hamner had a Volkswagen You see it s against the law for a small boy to be in the Nevada casinos but no one could take the stock-market page away from him Are you implying that Ed that he could Alice you re crazy I m not implying anything Unless maybe just that he knew what his daddy needed I know what you need It was almost as if the words had been spoken into her ear and she shuddered Mrs Hamner spent the next six years in and out of various mental institutions Supposedly for nervous disorders but the operative talked to an orderly who said she was pretty close to psychotic She claimed her son was the devil s henchman She stabbed him with a pair of scissors in Tried to kill him She Liz Liz what is it The scar she muttered We went swimming at the University pool on an open night about a month ago He s got a deep dimpled scar on his shoulder here She put her hand just above her left breast He said A wave of nausea tried to climb up her throat and she had to wait for it to recede before she could go on He said he fell on a picket fence when he was a little boy Shall I go on Finish why not What can it hurt now His mother was released from a very plush mental institution in the San Joaquin Valley in The three of them went on a vacation They stopped at a picnic spot on Route The boy was collecting firewood when she drove the car right over the edge of the dropoff above the ocean with both her and her husband in it It might have been an attempt to run Ed down By then he was nearly eighteen His father left him a million-dollar stock portfolio Ed came east a year and a half later and enrolled here And that s the end No more skeletons in the closet Liz aren t there enough She got up No wonder he never wants to mention his family But you had to dig up the corpse didn t you You re blind Alice said Elizabeth was putting on her coat I suppose you re going to him Right Because you love him Right Alice crossed the room and grabbed her arm Will you get that sulky petulant look off your face for a second and think Ed Hamner is able to do things the rest of us only dream about He got his father a stake at roulette and made him rich playing the stock market He seems to be able to will winning Maybe he s some kind of low-grade psychic Maybe he s got precognition I don t know There are people who seem to have a dose of that Liz hasn t it ever occurred to you that he s forced you to love him Liz turned to her slowly I ve never heard anything so ridiculous in my life Is it He gave you that sociology test the same way he gave his father the right side of the roulette board He was never enrolled in any sociology course I checked He did it because it was the only way he could make you take him seriously Stop it Liz cried She clapped her hands over her ears He knew the test and he knew when Tony was killed and he knew you were going home on a plane He even knew just the right psychological moment to step back into your life last October Elizabeth pulled away from her and opened the door Please Alice said Please Liz listen I don t know how he can do those things I doubt if even he knows for sure He might not mean to do you any harm but he already is He s made you love him by knowing every secret thing you want and need and that s not love at all That s rape Elizabeth slammed the door and ran down the stairs She caught the last bus of the evening into town It was snowing more heavily than ever and the bus lumbered through the drifts that had blown across the road like a crippled beetle Elizabeth sat in the back one of only six or seven passengers a thousand thoughts in her mind Menthol cigarettes The stock exchange The way he had known her mother s nickname was Deedee A little boy sitting at the back of a first-grade classroom making sheep s eyes at a vivacious little girl too young to understand that I know what you need No No No I do love him Did she Or was she simply delighted at being with someone who always ordered the right thing took her to the right movie and did not want to go anywhere or do anything she didn t Was he just a kind of psychic mirror showing her only what she wanted to see The presents he gave were always the right presents When the weather had turned suddenly cold and she had been longing for a hair dryer who gave her one Ed Hamner of course Just happened to see one on sale in Day s he had said She of course had been delighted That s not love at all That s rape The wind clawed at her face as she stepped out on the corner of Main and Mill and she winced against it as the bus drew away with a smooth diesel growl Its taillights twinkled briefly in the snowy night for a moment and were gone She had never felt so lonely in her life He wasn t home She stood outside his door after five minutes of knocking nonplussed It occurred to her that she had no idea what Ed did or whom he saw when he wasn t with her The subject had never come up Maybe he s raising the price of another hair dryer in a poker game With sudden decision she stood on her toes and felt along the top of the doorjamb for the spare key she knew he kept there Her fingers stumbled over it and it fell to the hall floor with a clink She picked it up and used it in the lock The apartment looked different with Ed gone artificial like a stage set It had often amused her that someone who cared so little about his personal appearance should have such a neat picture-book domicile Almost as if he had decorated it for her and not himself But of course that was crazy Wasn t it It occurred to her again as if for the first time how much she liked the chair she sat in when they studied or watched TV It was just right the way Baby Bear s chair had been for Goldilocks Not too hard not too soft Just right Like everything else she associated with Ed There were two doors opening off the living room One went to the kitchenette the other to his bedroom The wind whistled outside making the old apartment building creak and settle In the bedroom she stared at the brass bed It looked neither too hard nor too soft but just right An insidious voice smirked It s almost too perfect isn t it She went to the bookcase and ran her eye aimlessly over the titles One jumped at her eyes and she pulled it out Dance Crazes of the Fifties The book opened cleanly to a point some three-quarters through A section titled The Stroll had been circled heavily in red grease pencil and in the margin the word BETH had been written in large almost accusatory letters I ought to go now she told herself I can still save something If he came back now I could never look him in the face again and Alice would win Then she d really get her money s worth But she couldn t stop and knew it Things had gone too far She went to the closet and turned the knob but it didn t give Locked On the off chance she stood on tiptoe again and felt along the top of the door And her fingers felt a key She took it down and somewhere inside a voice said very clearly Don t do this She thought of Bluebeard s wife and what she had found when she opened the wrong door But it was indeed too late if she didn t proceed now she would always wonder She opened the closet And had the strangest feeling that this was where the real Ed Hamner Jr had been hiding all the time The closet was a mess a jumbled rickrack of clothes books an unstrung tennis racket a pair of tattered tennis shoes old prelims and reports tossed helter-skelter a spilled pouch of Borkum Riff pipe tobacco His green fatigue jacket had been flung in the far corner She picked up one of the books and blinked at the title The Golden Bough Another Ancient Rites Modern Mysteries Another Haitian Voodoo And a last one bound in old cracked leather the title almost rubbed off the binding by much handling smelling vaguely like rotted fish Necronomicon She opened it at random gasped and flung it away the obscenity still hanging before her eyes More to regain her composure than anything else she reached for the green fatigue jacket not admitting to herself that she meant to go through its pockets But as she lifted it she saw something else A small tin box Curiously she picked it up and turned it over in her hands hearing things rattle inside It was the kind of box a young boy might choose to keep his treasures in Stamped in raised letters on the tin bottom were the words Bridgeport Candy Co She opened it The doll was on top The Elizabeth doll She looked at it and began to shudder The doll was dressed in a scrap of red nylon part of a scarf she had lost two or three months back At a movie with Ed The arms were pipe cleaners that had been draped in stuff that looked like blue moss Graveyard moss perhaps There was hair on the doll s head but that was wrong It was fine white flax taped to the doll s pink gum-eraser head Her own hair was sandy blond and coarser than this This was more the way her hair had been When she was a little girl She swallowed and there was a clicking in her throat Hadn t they all been issued scissors in the first grade tiny scissors with rounded blade just right for a child s hand Had that long-ago little boy crept up behind her perhaps at nap time and Elizabeth put the doll aside and looked in the box again There was a blue poker chip with a strange six-sided pattern drawn on it in red ink A tattered newspaper obituary Mr and Mrs Edward Hamner The two of them smiled meaninglessly out of the accompanying photo and she saw that the same six-sided pattern had been drawn across their faces this time in black ink like a pall Two more dolls one male one female The similarity to the faces in the obituary photograph was hideous unmistakable And something else She fumbled it out and her fingers shook so badly she almost dropped it A tiny sound escaped her It was a model car the sort small boys buy in drugstores and hobby shops and then assemble with airplane glue This one was a Fiat It had been painted red And a piece of what looked like one of Tony s shirts had been taped to the front She turned the model car upside down Someone had hammered the underside to fragments So you found it you ungrateful bitch She screamed and dropped the car and the box His foul treasures sprayed across the floor He was standing in the doorway looking at her She had never seen such a look of hate on a human face She said You killed Tony He grinned unpleasantly Do you think you could prove it It doesn t matter she said surprised at the steadiness of her own voice I know And I never want to see you again Ever And if you do anything to anyone else I ll know And I ll fix you Somehow His face twisted That s the thanks I get I gave you everything you ever wanted Things no other man could have Admit it I made you perfectly happy You killed Tony She screamed it at him He took another step into the room Yes and I did it for you And what are you Beth You don t know what love is I loved you from the first time I saw you over seventeen years ago Could Tony say that It s never been hard for you You re pretty You never had to think about wanting or needing or about being lonely You never had to find other ways to get the things you had to have There was always a Tony to give them to you All you ever had to do was smile and say please His voice rose a note I could never get what I wanted that way Don t you think I tried It didn t work with my father He just wanted more and more He never even kissed me good night or gave me a hug until I made him rich And my mother was the same way I gave her her marriage back but was that enough for her She hated me She wouldn t come near me She said I was unnatural I gave her nice things but Beth don t do that Don t dooon t She stepped on the Elizabeth doll and crushed it turning her heel on it Something inside her flared in agony and then was gone She wasn t afraid of him now He was just a small shrunken boy in a young man s body And his socks didn t match I don t think you can do anything to me now Ed she told him Not now Am I wrong He turned from her Go on he said weakly Get out But leave my box At least do that I ll leave the box But not the things in it She walked past him His shoulders twitched as if he might turn and try to grab her but then they slumped As she reached the second-floor landing he came to the top of the stairs and called shrilly after her Go on then But you ll never be satisfied with any man after me And when your looks go and men stop trying to give you anything you want you ll wish for me You ll think of what you threw away She went down the stairs and out into the snow Its coldness felt good against her face It was a two-mile walk back to the campus but she didn t care She wanted the walk wanted the cold She wanted it to make her clean In a queer twisted way she felt sorry for him a little boy with a huge power crammed inside a dwarfed spirit A little boy who tried to make humans behave like toy soldiers and then stamped on them in a fit of temper when they wouldn t or when they found out And what was she Blessed with all the things he was not through no fault of his or effort of her own She remembered the way she had reacted to Alice trying blindly and jealously to hold onto something that was easy rather than good not caring not caring When your looks go and men stop trying to give you anything you want you ll wish for me know what you need But was she so small that she actually needed so little Please dear God no On the bridge between the campus and town she paused and threw Ed Hamner s scraps of magic over the side piece by piece The red-painted model Fiat went last falling end over end into the driven snow until it was lost from sight Then she walked on CHILDREN OF THE CORN Burt turned the radio on too loud and didn t turn it down because they were on the verge of another argument and he didn t want it to happen He was desperate for it not to happen Vicky said something What he shouted Turn it down Do you want to break my eardrums He bit down hard on what might have come through his mouth and turned it down Vicky was fanning herself with her scarf even though the T-Bird was air-conditioned Where are we anyway Nebraska She gave him a cold neutral look Yes Burt I know we re in Nebraska Burt But where the hell are we You ve got the road atlas Look it up Or can t you read Such wit This is why we got off the turnpike So we could look at three hundred miles of corn And enjoy the wit and wisdom of Burt Robeson He was gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white He decided he was holding it that tightly because if he loosened up why one of those hands might just fly off and hit the ex-Prom Queen beside him right in the chops We re saving our marriage he told himself Yes We re doing it the same way us grunts went about saving villages in the war Vicky he said carefully I have driven fifteen hundred miles on turnpikes since we left Boston I did all that driving myself because you refused to drive Then I did not refuse Vicky said hotly Just because I get migraines when I drive for a long time Then when I asked you if you d navigate for me on some of the secondary roads you said sure Burt Those were your exact words Sure Burt Then Sometimes I wonder how I ever wound up married to you By saying two little words She stared at him for a moment white-lipped and then picked up the road atlas She turned the pages savagely It had been a mistake leaving the turnpike Burt thought morosely It was a shame too because up until then they had been doing pretty well treating each other almost like human beings It had sometimes seemed that this trip to the coast ostensibly to see Vicky s brother and his wife but actually a last-ditch attempt to patch up their own marriage was going to work But since they left the pike it had been bad again How bad Well terrible actually We left the turnpike at Hamburg right Right There s nothing more until Gatlin she said Twenty miles Wide place in the road Do you suppose we could stop there and get something to eat Or does your almighty schedule say we have to go until two o clock like we did yesterday He took his eyes off the road to look at her I ve about had it Vicky As far as I m concerned we can turn around right here and go home and see that lawyer you wanted to talk to Because this isn t working at She had faced forward again her expression stonily set It suddenly turned to surprise and fear Burt look out you re going to He turned his attention back to the road just in time to see something vanish under the T-Bird s bumper A moment later while he was only beginning to switch from gas to brake he felt something thump sickeningly under the front and then the back wheels They were thrown forward as the car braked along the centerline decelerating from fifty to zero along black skidmarks A dog he said Tell me it was a dog Vicky Her face was a pallid cottage-cheese color A boy A little boy He just ran out of the corn and congratulations tiger She fumbled the car door open leaned out threw up Burt sat straight behind the T-Bird s wheel hands still gripping it loosely He was aware of nothing for a long time but the rich dark smell of fertilizer Then he saw that Vicky was gone and when he looked in the outside mirror he saw her stumbling clumsily back toward a heaped bundle that looked like a pile of rags She was ordinarily a graceful woman but now her grace was gone robbed It s manslaughter That s what they call it I took my eyes off the road He turned the ignition off and got out The wind rustled softly through the growing man-high corn making a weird sound like respiration Vicky was standing over the bundle of rags now and he could hear her sobbing He was halfway between the car and where she stood and something caught his eye on the left a gaudy splash of red amid all the green as bright as barn paint He stopped looking directly into the corn He found himself thinking anything to untrack from those rags that were not rags that it must have been a fantastically good growing season for corn It grew close together almost ready to bear You could plunge into those neat shaded rows and spend a day trying to find your way out again But the neatness was broken here Several tall cornstalks had been broken and leaned askew And what was that further back in the shadows Burt Vicky screamed at him Don t you want to come see So you can tell all your poker buddies what you bagged in Nebraska Don t you But the rest was lost in fresh sobs Her shadow was puddled starkly around her feet It was almost noon Shade closed over him as he entered the corn The red barn paint was blood There was a low somnolent buzz as flies lit tasted and buzzed off again maybe to tell others There was more blood on the leaves further in Surely it couldn t have splattered this far And then he was standing over the object he had seen from the road He picked it up The neatness of the rows was disturbed here Several stalks were canted drunkenly two of them had been broken clean off The earth had been gouged There was blood The corn mstled With a little shiver he walked back to the road Vicky was having hysterics screaming unintelligible words at him crying laughing Who would have thought it could end in such a melodramatic way He looked at her and saw he wasn t having an identity crisis or a difficult life transition or any of those trendy things He hated her He gave her a hard slap across the face She stopped short and put a hand against the reddening impression of his fingers You ll go to jail Burt she said solemnly I don t think so he said and put the suitcase he had found in the corn at her feet What I don t know I guess it belonged to him He pointed to the sprawled face-down body that lay in the road No more than thirteen from the look of him The suitcase was old The brown leather was battered and scuffed Two hanks of clothesline had been wrapped around it and tied in large clownish grannies Vicky bent to undo one of them saw the blood greased into the knot and withdrew Burt knelt and turned the body over gently I don t want to look Vicky said staring down helplessly anyway And when the staring sightless face flopped up to regard them she screamed again The boy s face was dirty his expression a grimace of terror His throat had been cut Burt got up and put his arms around Vicky as she began to sway Don t faint he said very quietly Do you hear me Vicky Don t faint He repeated it over and over and at last she began to recover and held him tight They might have been dancing there on the noon-struck road with the boy s corpse at their feet Vicky What Muffled against his shirt Go back to the car and put the keys in your pocket Get the blanket out of the back seat and my rifle Bring them here The rifle Someone cut his throat Maybe whoever is watching us Her head jerked up and her wide eyes considered the corn It marched away as far as the eye could see undulating up and down small dips and rises of land I imagine he s gone But why take chances Go on Do it She walked stiltedly back to the car her shadow following a dark mascot who stuck close at this hour of the day When she leaned into the back seat Burt squatted beside the boy White male no distinguishing marks Run over yes but the T-Bird hadn t cut the kid s throat It had been cut raggedly and inefficiently no army sergeant had shown the killer the finer points of hand-to-hand assassination but the final effect had been deadly He had either run or been pushed through the last thirty feet of corn dead or mortally wounded And Burt Robeson had run him down If the boy had still been alive when the car hit him his life had been cut short by thirty seconds at most Vicky tapped him on the shoulder and he jumped She was standing with the brown army blanket over her left arm the cased pump shotgun in her right hand her face averted He took the blanket and spread it on the road He rolled the body onto it Vicky uttered a desperate little moan You okay He looked up at her Vicky Okay she said in a strangled voice He flipped the sides of the blanket over the body and scooped it up hating the thick dead weight of it It tried to make a U in his arms and slither through his grasp He clutched it tighter and they walked back to the T-Bird Open the trunk he grunted The trunk was full of travel stuff suitcases and souvenirs Vicky shifted most of it into the back seat and Burt slipped the body into the made space and slammed the trunklid down A sigh of relief escaped him Vicky was standing by the driver s side door still holding the cased rifle Just put it in the back and get in He looked at his watch and saw only fifteen minutes had passed It seemed like hours What about the suitcase she asked He trotted back down the road to where it stood on the white line like the focal point in an Impressionist painting He picked it up by its tattered handle and paused for a moment He had a strong sensation of being watched It was a feeling he had read about in books mostly cheap fiction and he had always doubted its reality Now he didn t It was as if there were people in the corn maybe a lot of them coldly estimating whether the woman could get the gun out of the case and use it before they could grab him drag him into the shady rows cut his throat Heart beating thickly he ran back to the car pulled the keys out of the trunk lock and got in Vicky was crying again Burt got them moving and before a minute had passed he could no longer pick out the spot where it had happened in the rearview mirror What did you say the next town was he asked Oh She bent over the road atlas again Gatlin We should be there in ten minutes Does it look big enough to have a police station No It s just a dot Maybe there s a constable They drove in silence for a while They passed a silo on the left Nothing else but corn Nothing passed them going the other way not even a farm truck Have we passed anything since we got off the turnpike Vicky She thought about it A car and a tractor At that intersection No since we got on this road Route No I don t think we have Earlier this might have been the preface to some cutting remark Now she only stared out of her half of the windshield at the unrolling road and the endless dotted line Vicky Could you open the suitcase Do you think it might matter Don t know It might While she picked at the knots her face was set in a peculiar way expressionless but tight-mouthed that Burt remembered his mother wearing when she pulled the innards out of the Sunday chicken Burt turned on the radio again The pop station they had been listening to was almost obliterated in static and Burt switched running the red marker slowly down the dial Farm reports Buck Owens Tammy Wynette All distant nearly distorted into babble Then near the end of the dial one single word blared out of the speaker so loud and clear that the lips which uttered it might have been directly beneath the grill of the dashboard speaker ATONEMENT this voice bellowed Burt made a surprised grunting sound Vicky jumped ONLYBY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB ARE WE SAVED the voice roared and Burt hurriedly turned the sound down This station was close all right So close that yes there it was Poking out of the corn at the horizon a spidery red tripod against the blue The radio tower Atonement is the word brothers n sisters the voice told them dropping to a more conversational pitch In the background offmike voices murmured amen There s some that thinks it s okay to get out in the world as if you could work and walk in the world without being smirched by the world Now is that what the word of God teaches us Offmike but still loud No HOLY JESUS the evangelist shouted and now the words came in a powerful pumping cadence almost as compelling as a driving rock-and-roll beat When they gonna know that way is death When they gonna know that the wages of the world are paid on the other side Huh Huh The Lord has said there s many mansions in His house But there s no room for the fornicator No room for the coveter No room for the defiler of the corn No room for the hommasexshul No room Vicky snapped it off That drivel makes me sick What did he say Burt asked her What did he say about corn I didn t hear it She was picking at the second clothesline knot He said something about corn I know he did I got it Vicky said and the suitcase fell open in her lap They were passing a sign that said gatlin ml drive carefully protect our children The sign had been put up by the Elks There were bullet holes in it Socks Vicky said Two pairs of pants a shirt a belt a string tie with a She held it up showing him the peeling gilt neck clasp Who s that Burt glanced at it Hopalong Cassidy I think Oh She put it back She was crying again After a moment Burt said Did anything strike you funny about that radio sermon No I heard enough of that stuff as a kid to last me forever I told you about it Didn t you think he sounded kind of young That preacher She uttered a mirthless laugh A teen-ager maybe so what That s what s so monstrous about that whole trip They like to get hold of them when their minds are still rubber They know how to put all the emotional checks and balances in You should have been at some of the tent meetings my mother and father dragged me to some of the ones I was saved at Let s see There was Baby Hortense the Singing Marvel She was eight She d come on and sing Leaning on the Ever-lasting Arms while her daddy passed the plate telling everybody to dig deep now let s not let this little child of God down Then there was Norman Staunton He used to preach hellfire and brimstone in this Little Lord Fauntleroy suit with short pants He was only seven She nodded at his look of unbelief They weren t the only two either There were plenty of them on the circuit They were good draws She spat the word Ruby Stampnell She was a ten-year-old faith healer The Grace Sisters They used to come out with little tin-foil haloes over their heads and oh What is it He jerked around to look at her and what she was holding in her hands Vicky was staring at it raptly Her slowly seining hands had snagged it on the bottom of the suitcase and had brought it up as she talked Burt pulled over to take a better look She gave it to him wordlessly It was a crucifix that had been made from twists of corn husk once green now dry Attached to this by woven cornsilk was a dwarf corncob Most of the kernels had been carefully removed probably dug out one at a time with a pocketknife Those kernels remaining formed a crude cruciform figure in yellowish bas-relief Corn-kernel eyes each slit longways to suggest pupils Outstretched kernel arms the legs together terminating in a rough indication of bare feet Above four letters also raised from the bone-white cob I NR I That s a fantastic piece of workmanship he said It s hideous she said in a flat strained voice Throw it out Vicky the police might want to see it Why Well I don t know why Maybe Throw it out Will you please do that for me I don t want it in the car I ll put it in back And as soon as we see the cops we ll get rid of it one way or the other I promise Okay Oh do whatever you want with it she shouted at him You will anyway Troubled he threw the thing in back where it landed on a pile of clothes Its corn- kernel eyes stared raptly at the T-Bird s dome light He pulled out again gravel splurting from beneath the tires We ll give the body and everything that was in the suitcase to the cops he promised Then we ll be shut of it Vicky didn t answer She was looking at her hands A mile further on the endless cornfields drew away from the road showing farmhouses and outbuildings In one yard they saw dirty chickens pecking listlessly at the soil There were faded cola and chewing-tobacco ads on the roofs of barns They passed a tall billboard that said only jesus saves They passed a cafe with a Conoco gas island but Burt decided to go on into the center of town if there was one If not they could come bake to the cafe It only occurred to him after they had passed it that the parking lot had been empty except for a dirty old pickup that had looked like it was sitting on two flat tires Vicky suddenly began to laugh a high giggling sound that struck Burt as being dangerously close to hysteria What s so funny The signs she said gasping and hiccupping Haven t you been reading them When they called this the Bible Belt they sure weren t kidding Oh Lordy there s another bunch Another burst of hysterical laughter escaped her and she clapped both hands over her mouth Each sign had only one word They were leaning on white-washed sticks that had been implanted in the sandy shoulder long ago by the looks the whitewash was flaked and faded They were coming up at eighty-foot intervals and Burt read A CLOUD BY DAY A PILLAR OF FIRE BY NIGHT They only forgot one thing Vicky said still giggling helplessly What Burt asked frowning Burma Shave She held a knuckled fist against her open mouth to keep in the laughter but her semi-hysterical giggles flowed around it like effervescent ginger-ale bubbles Vicky are you all right I will be Just as soon as we re a thousand miles away from here in sunny sinful California with the Rockies between us and Nebraska Another group of signs came up and they read them silently TAKE THIS AND EAT SAITH THE LORD GOD Now why Burt thought should I immediately associate that indefinite pronoun with corn Isn t that what they say when they give you communion It had been so long since he had been to church that he really couldn t remember He wouldn t be surprised if they used cornbread for holy wafer around these parts He opened his mouth to tell Vicky that and then thought better of it They breasted a gentle rise and there was Gatlin below them all three blocks of it looking like a set from a movie about the Depression There ll be a constable Burt said and wondered why the sight of that hick one- timetable town dozing in the sun should have brought a lump of dread into his throat They passed a speed sign proclaiming that no more than thirty was now in order and another sign rust-flecked which said you are now entering gatlin nicest little town IN NEBRASKA OR ANYWHERE ELSE POP Dusty elms stood on both sides of the road most of them diseased They passed the Gatlin Lumberyard and a gas station where the price signs swung slowly in a hot noon breeze reg hi-test and another which said hi truckers diesel fuel around back They crossed Elm Street then Birch Street and came up on the town square The houses lining the streets were plain wood with screened porches Angular and functional The lawns were yellow and dispirited Up ahead a mongrel dog walked slowly out into the middle of Maple Street stood looking at them for a moment then lay down in the road with its nose on its paws Stop Vicky said Stop right here Burt pulled obediently to the curb Turn around Let s take the body to Grand Island That s not too far is it Let s do that Vicky what s wrong What do you mean what s wrong she asked her voice rising thinly This town is empty Burt There s nobody here but us Can t you feel that He had felt something and still felt it But It just seems that way he said But it sure is a one-hydrant town Probably all up in the square having a bake sale or a bingo game There s no one here She said the words with a queer strained emphasis Didn t you see that station back there Sure by the lumberyard so what His mind was elsewhere listening to the dull buzz of a cicada burrowing into one of the nearby elms He could smell corn dusty roses and fertilizer of course For the first time they were off the turnpike and in a town A town in a state he had never been in before although he had flown over it from time to time in United Airlines s and somehow it felt all wrong but all right Somewhere up ahead there would be a drugstore with a soda fountain a movie house named the Bijou a school named after JFK Burt the prices said thirty-five-nine for regular and thirty-eight-nine for high octane Now how long has it been since anyone in this country paid those prices At least four years he admitted But Vicky We re right in town Burt and there s not a car Not one car Grand Island is seventy miles away It would look funny if we took him there I don t care Look let s just drive up to the courthouse and No There damn it there Why our marriage is falling apart in a nutshell No I won t No sir And furthermore I ll hold my breath till I turn blue if you don t let me have my way Vicky he said I want to get out of here Burt Vicky listen to me Turn around Let s go Vicky will you stop a minute I ll stop when we re driving the other way Now let s go We have a dead child in the trunk of our car he roared at her and took a distinct pleasure at the way she flinched the way her face crumbled In a slightly lower voice he went on His throat was cut and he was shoved out into the road and I ran him over Now I m going to drive up to the courthouse or whatever they have here and I m going to report it If you want to start walking back toward the pike go to it I ll pick you up But don t you tell me to turn around and drive seventy miles to Grand Island like we had nothing in the trunk but a bag of garbage He happens to be some mother s son and I m going to report it before whoever killed him gets over the hills and far away You bastard she said crying What am I doing with you I don t know he said I don t know anymore But the situation can be remedied Vicky He pulled away from the curb The dog lifted its head at the brief squeal of the tires and then lowered it to its paws again They drove the remaining block to the square At the corner of Main and Pleasant Main Street split in two There actually was a town square a grassy park with a bandstand in the middle On the other end where Main Street became one again there were two official looking buildings Burt could make out the lettering on one gatlin municipal center That s it he said Vicky said nothing Halfway up the square Burt pulled over again They were beside a lunch room the Gatlin Bar and Grill Where are you going Vicky asked with alarm as he opened his door To find out where everyone is Sign in the window there says open You re not going to leave me here alone So come Who s stopping you She unlocked her door and stepped out as he crossed in front of the car He saw how pale her face was and felt an instant of pity Hopeless pity Do you hear it she asked as he joined her Hear what The nothing No cars No people No tractors Nothing And then from a block over they heard the high and joyous laughter of children I hear kids he said Don t you She looked at him troubled He opened the lunchroom door and stepped into dry antiseptic heat The floor was dusty The sheen on the chrome was dull The wooden blades of the ceiling fans stood still Empty tables Empty counter stools But the mirror behind the counter had been shattered and there was something else in a moment he had it All the beer taps had been broken off They lay along the counter like bizarre party favors Vicky s voice was gay and near to breaking Sure Ask anybody Pardon me sir but could you tell me Oh shut up But his voice was dull and without force They were standing in a bar of dusty sunlight that fell through the lunchroom s big plate-glass window and again he had that feeling of being watched and he thought of the boy they had in their trunk and of the high laughter of children A phrase came to him for no reason a legal-sounding phrase and it began to repeat mystically in his mind Sight unseen Sight unseen Sight unseen His eyes traveled over the age-yellowed cards thumbtacked up behind the counter CHEESEBURG t WORLD S BEST JOE IOC STRAWBERRY RHUBARB PIE t TODAY S SPECIAL HAM RED EYE GRAVY W MASHED POT t How long since he had seen lunchroom prices like that Vicky had the answer Look at this she said shrilly She was pointing at the calendar on the wall They ve been at that bean supper for twelve years I guess She uttered a grinding laugh He walked over The picture showed two boys swimming in a pond while a cute little dog carried off their clothes Below the picture was the legend compliments of gatlin lumber hardware You Breakum We Fixum The month on view was August I don t understand he faltered but I m sure You re sure she cried hysterically Sure you re sure That s part of your trouble Burt you ve spent your whole life being sure He turned back to the door and she came after him Where are you going To the Municipal Center Burt why do you have to be so stubborn You know something s wrong here Can t you just admit it I m not being stubborn I just want to get shut of what s in that trunk They stepped out onto the sidewalk and Burt was struck afresh with the town s silence and with the smell of fertilizer Somehow you never thought of that smell when you buttered an ear and salted it and bit in Compliments of sun rain all sorts of man-made phosphates and a good healthy dose of cow shit But somehow this smell was different from the one he had grown up with in rural upstate New York You could say whatever you wanted to about organic fertilizer but there was something almost fragrant about it when the spreader was laying it down in the fields Not one of your great perfumes God no but when the late-afternoon spring breeze would pick up and waft it over the freshly turned fields it was a smell with good associations It meant winter was over for good It meant that school doors were going to bang closed in six weeks or so and spill everyone out into summer It was a smell tied irrevocably in his mind with other aromas that were perfume timothy grass clover fresh earth hollyhocks dogwood But they must do something different out here he thought The smell was close but not the same There was a sickish-sweet undertone Almost a death smell As a medical orderly in Vietnam he had become well versed in that smell Vicky was sitting quietly in the car holding the corn crucifix in her lap and staring at it in a rapt way Burt didn t like Put that thing down he said No she said without looking up You play your games and I ll play mine He put the car in gear and drove up to the corner A dead stoplight hung overhead swinging in a faint breeze To the left was a neat white church The grass was cut Neatly kept flowers grew beside the flagged path up to the door Burt pulled over What are you doing I m going to go in and take a look Burt said It s the only place in town that looks as if there isn t ten years dust on it And look at the sermon board She looked Neatly pegged white letters under glass read the power and grace of he who walks behind the rows The date was July the Sunday before He Who Walks Behind the Rows Burt said turning off the ignition One of the nine thousand names of God only used in Nebraska I guess Coming She didn t smile I m not going in with you Fine Whatever you want I haven t been in a church since I left home and I don t want to be in this church and I don t want to be in this town Burt I m scared out of my mind can t we just go I ll only be a minute I ve got my keys Burt If you re not back in five minutes I ll just drive away and leave you here Now just wait a minute lady That s what I m going to do Unless you want to assault me like a common mugger and take my keys I suppose you could do that But you don t think I will No Her purse was on the seat between them He snatched it up She screamed and grabbed for the shoulder strap He pulled it out of her reach Not bothering to dig he simply turned the bag upside down and let everything fall out Her keyring glittered amid tissues cosmetics change old shopping lists She lunged for it but he beat her again and put the keys in his own pocket You didn t have to do that she said crying Give them to me No he said and gave her a hard meaningless grin No way Please Burt I m scared She held her hand out pleading now You d wait two minutes and decide that was long enough I wouldn t And then you d drive off laughing and saying to yourself That ll teach Burt to cross me when I want something Hasn t that pretty much been your motto during our married life That ll teach Burt to cross me He got out of the car Please Burt she screamed sliding across the seat Listen I know we ll drive out of town and call from a phone booth okay I ve got all kinds of change I just we can don t leave me alone Burt don t leave me out here alone He slammed the door on her cry and then leaned against the side of the T-Bird for a moment thumbs against his closed eyes She was pounding on the driver s side window and calling his name She was going to make a wonderful impression when he finally found someone in authority to take charge of the kid s body Oh yes He turned and walked up the flagstone path to the church doors Two or three minutes just a look-around and he would be back out Probably the door wasn t even unlocked But it pushed in easily on silent well-oiled hinges reverently oiled he thought and that seemed funny for no really good reason and he stepped into a vestibule so cool it was almost chilly It took his eyes a moment to adjust to the dimness The first thing he noticed was a pile of wooden letters in the far corner dusty and jumbled indifferently together He went to them curious They looked as old and forgotten as the calendar in the bar and grill unlike the rest of the vestibule which was dust-free and tidy The letters were about two feet high obviously part of a set He spread them out on the carpet there were eighteen of them and shifted them around like anagrams hurt bite crag chap cs Nope crap target chibs huc That wasn t much good either Except for the ch in chibs He quickly assembled the word church and was left looking at rap taget cibs Foolish He was squatting here playing idiot games with a bunch of letters while Vicky was going nuts out in the car He started to get up and then saw it He formed baptist leaving rag ec and by changing two letters he had grace grace baptist church The letters must have been out front They had taken them down and had thrown them indifferently in the corner and the church had been painted since then so that you couldn t even see where the letters had been Why It wasn t the Grace Baptist Church anymore that was why So what kind of church was it For some reason that question caused a trickle of fear and he stood up quickly dusting his fingers So they had taken down a bunch of letters so what Maybe they had changed the place into Flip Wilson s Church of What s Happening Now But what had happened then He shook it off impatiently and went through the inner doors Now he was standing at the back of the church itself and as he looked toward the nave he felt fear close around his heart and squeeze tightly His breath drew in loud in the pregnant silence of this place The space behind the pulpit was dominated by a gigantic portrait of Christ and Burt thought If nothing else in this town gave Vicky the screaming meemies this would The Christ was grinning vulpine His eyes were wide and staring reminding Burt uneasily of Fon Chaney in The Phantom of the Opera In each of the wide black pupils someone a sinner presumably was drowning in a lake of fire But the oddest thing was that this Christ had green hair hair which on closer examination revealed itself to be a twining mass of early-summer corn The picture was crudely done but effective It looked like a comic-strip mural done by a gifted child an Old Testament Christ or a pagan Christ that might slaughter his sheep for sacrifice instead of leading them At the foot of the left-hand rank of pews was a pipe organ and Burt could not at first tell what was wrong with it He walked down the left-hand aisle and saw with slowly dawning horror that the keys had been ripped up the stops had been pulled out and the pipes themselves filled with dry cornhusks Over the organ was a carefully lettered plaque which read make no music except with human tongue saith the lord god Vicky was right Something was terribly wrong here He debated going back to Vicky without exploring any further just getting into the car and leaving town as quickly as possible never mind the Municipal Building But it grated on him Tell the truth he thought You want to give her Ban a work-out before going back and admitting she was right to start with He would go back out in a minute or so He walked toward the pulpit thinking People must go through Gatlin all the time There must be people in the neighboring towns who have friends and relatives here The Nebraska SP must cruise through from time to time And what about the power company The stoplight had been dead Surely they d know if the power had been off for twelve long years Conclusion What seemed to have happened in Gatlin was impossible Still he had the creeps He climbed the four carpeted steps to the pulpit and looked out over the deserted pews glimmering in the half-shadows He seemed to feel the weight of those eldritch and decidedly unchristian eyes boring into his back There was a large Bible on the lectern opened to the thirty-eighth chapter of Job Burt glanced down at it and read Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding The lord He Who Walks Behind the Rows Declare if thou hast understanding And please pass the corn He fluttered the pages of the Bible and they made a dry whispering sound in the quiet the sound that ghosts might make if there really were such things And in a place like this you could almost believe it Sections of the Bible had been chopped out Mostly from the New Testament he saw Someone had decided to take on the job of amending Good King James with a pair of scissors But the Old Testament was intact He was about to leave the pulpit when he saw another book on a lower shelf and took it out thinking it might be a church record of weddings and confirmations and burials He grimaced at the words stamped on the cover done inexpertly in gold leaf thus let THE INIQUITOUS BE CUT DOWN SO THAT THE GROUND MAY BE FERTILE AGAIN SAITH THE LORD GOD OF HOSTS There seemed to be one train of thought around here and Burt didn t care much for the track it seemed to ride on He opened the book to the first wide lined sheet A child had done the lettering he saw immediately In places an ink eraser had been carefully used and while there were no misspellings the letters were large and childishly made drawn rather than written The first column read Amos Deigan Richard b Sept Isaac Renfrew William b Sept Zepeniah Kirk George b Oct Mary Wells Roberta b Nov Yemen Hollis Edward b Jan Sept Sept Oct Nov Jan Frowning Burt continued to turn through the pages Three-quarters of the way through the double columns ended abruptly Rachel Stigman Donna b June June Moses Richardson Henry b July Malachi Boardman Craig b August The last entry in the book was for Ruth Clawson Sandra b April Burt looked at the shelf where he had found this book and came up with two more The first had the same iniquitous be cut down logo and it continued the same record the single column tracing birth dates and names In early September of he found Job Gilman Clayton b September and the next entry was Eve Tobin b June No second name in parentheses The third book was blank Standing behind the pulpit Burt thought about it Something had happened in Something to do with religion and corn and children Dear God we beg thy blessing on the crop For Jesus sake amen And the knife raised high to sacrifice the lamb but had it been a lamb Perhaps a religious mania had swept them Alone all alone cut off from the outside world by hundreds of square miles of the rustling secret corn Alone under seventy million acres of blue sky Alone under the watchful eye of God now a strange green God a God of corn grown old and strange and hungry He Who Walks Behind the Rows Burt felt a chill creep into his flesh Vicky let me tell you a story It s about Amos Deigan who was born Richard Deigan on September He took the name Amos in fine Old Testament name Amos one of the minor prophets Well Vicky what happened don t laugh is that Dick Deigan and his friends Billy Renfrew George Kirk Roberta Wells and Eddie Hollis among others they got religion and they killed off their parents All of them Isn t that a scream Shot them in their beds knifed them in their bathtubs poisoned their suppers hung them or disemboweled them for all I know Why The corn Maybe it was dying Maybe they got the idea somehow that it was dying because there was too much sinning Not enough sacrifice They would have done it in the corn in the rows And somehow Vicky I m quite sure of this somehow they decided that nineteen was as old as any of them could live Richard Amos Deigan the hero of our little story had his nineteenth birthday on September the date in the book I think maybe they killed him Sacrificed him in the corn Isn t that a silly story But let s look at Rachel Stigman who was Donna Stigman until She turned nineteen on June just about a month ago Moses Richardson was born on July just three days from today he ll be nineteen Any idea what s going to happen to ole Mose on the twenty-ninth I can guess Burt licked his lips which felt dry One other thing Vicky Look at this We have Job Gilman Clayton born on September No other births until June A gap of ten months Know what I think They killed all the parents even the pregnant ones that s what I think And one of them got pregnant in October of and gave birth to Eve Some sixteen- or seventeen-year- old girl Eve The first woman He thumbed back through the book feverishly and found the Eve Tobin entry Below it Adam Greenlaw b July They d be just eleven now he thought and his flesh began to crawl And maybe they re out there Someplace But how could such a thing be kept secret How could it go on How unless the God in question approved Oh Jesus Burt said into the silence and that was when the T-Bird s horn began to blare into the afternoon one long continuous blast Burt jumped from the pulpit and ran down the center aisle He threw open the outer vestibule door letting in hot sunshine dazzling Vicky was bolt upright behind the steering wheel both hands plastered on the horn ring her head swiveling wildly From all around the children were coming Some of them were laughing gaily They held knives hatchets pipes rocks hammers One girl maybe eight with beautiful long blond hair held a jackhandle Rural weapons Not a gun among them Burt felt a wild urge to scream out Which of you is Adam and Eve Who are the mothers Who are the daughters Fathers Sons Declare if thou hast understanding They came from the side streets from the town green through the gate in the chain-link fence around the school playground a block further west Some of them glanced indifferently at Burt standing frozen on the church steps and some nudged each other and pointed and smiled the sweet smiles of children The girls were dressed in long brown wool and faded sunbonnets The boys like Quaker parsons were all in black and wore round-crowned flat-brimmed hats They streamed across the town square toward the car across lawns a few came across the front yard of what had been the Grace Baptist Church until One or two of them almost close enough to touch The shotgun Burt yelled Vicky get the shotgun But she was frozen in her panic he could see that from the steps He doubted if she could even hear him through the closed windows They converged on the Thunderbird The axes and hatchets and chunks of pipe began to rise and fall My God am I seeing this he thought frozenly An arrow of chrome fell off the side of the car The hood ornament went flying Knives scrawled spirals through the sidewalls of the tires and the car settled The horn blared on and on The windshield and side windows went opaque and cracked under the onslaught and then the safety glass sprayed inward and he could see again Vicky was crouched back only one hand on the horn ring now the other thrown up to protect her face Eager young hands reached in fumbling for the lock unlock button She beat them away wildly The horn became intermittent and then stopped altogether The beaten and dented driver s side door was hauled open They were trying to drag her out but her hands were wrapped around the steering wheel Then one of them leaned in knife in hand and His paralysis broke and he plunged down the steps almost falling and ran down the flagstone walk toward them One of them a boy of about sixteen with long red hair spilling out from beneath his hat turned toward him almost casually and something flicked through the air Burt s left arm jerked backward and for a moment he had the absurd thought that he had been punched at long distance Then the pain came so sharp and sudden that the world went gray He examined his arm with a stupid sort of wonder A buck and a half Pensy jackknife was growing out of it like a strange tumor The sleeve of his J C Penney sport shirt was turning red He looked at it for what seemed like forever trying to understand how he could have grown a jackknife was it possible When he looked up the boy with the red hair was almost on top of him He was grinning confident Hey you bastard Burt said His voice was creaking shocked Remand your soul to God for you will stand before His throne momentarily the boy with the red hair said and clawed for Burt s eyes Burt stepped back pulled the Pensy out of his arm and stuck it into the red-haired boy s throat The gush of blood was immediate gigantic Burt was splashed with it The red- haired boy began to gobble and walk in a large circle He clawed at the knife trying to pull it free and was unable Burt watched him jaw hanging agape None of this was happening It was a dream The red-haired boy gobbled and walked Now his sound was the only one in the hot early afternoon The others watched stunned This part of it wasn t in the script Burt thought numbly Vicky and I we were in the script And the boy in the corn who was trying to run away But not one of their own He stared at them savagely wanting to scream How do you like it The red-haired boy gave one last weak gobble and sank to his knees He stared up at Burt for a moment and then his hands dropped away from the haft of the knife and he fell forward A soft sighing sound from the children gathered around the Thunderbird They stared at Burt Burt stared back at them fascinated and that was when he noticed that Vicky was gone Where is she he asked Where did you take her One of the boys raised a blood-streaked hunting knife toward his throat and made a sawing motion there He grinned That was the only answer From somewhere in back an older boy s voice soft Get him The boys began to walk toward him Burt backed up They began to walk faster Burt backed up faster The shotgun the goddamned shotgun Out of reach The sun cut their shadows darkly on the green church lawn and then he was on the sidewalk He turned and ran Kill him someone roared and they came after him He ran but not quite blindly He skirted the Municipal Building no help there they would corner him like a rat and ran on up Main Street which opened out and became the highway again two blocks further up He and Vicky would have been on that road now and away if he had only listened His loafers slapped against the sidewalk Ahead of him he could see a few more business buildings including the Gatlin Ice Cream Shoppe and sure enough the Bijou Theater The dust-clotted marquee letters read now howing l mited en agemen eli a th taylor cleopa ra Beyond the next cross street was a gas station that marked the edge of town And beyond that the corn closing back in to the sides of the road A green tide of corn Burt ran He was already out of breath and the knife wound in his upper arm was beginning to hurt And he was leaving a trail of blood As he ran he yanked his handkerchief from his back pocket and stuck it inside his shirt He ran His loafers pounded the cracked cement of the sidewalk his breath rasped in his throat with more and more heat His arm began to throb in earnest Some mordant part of his brain tried to ask if he thought he could run all the way to the next town if he could mn twenty miles of two-lane blacktop He ran Behind him he could hear them fifteen years younger and faster than he was gaining Their feet slapped on the pavement They whooped and shouted back and forth to each other They re having more fun than a five-alarm fire Burt thought disjointedly They ll talk about it for years Burt ran He ran past the gas station marking the edge of town His breath gasped and roared in his chest The sidewalk ran out under his feet And now there was only one thing to do only one chance to beat them and escape with his life The houses were gone the town was gone The corn had surged in a soft green wave back to the edges of the road The green swordlike leaves rustled softly It would be deep in there deep and cool shady in the rows of man-high corn He ran past a sign that said you are now leaving gatlin nicest little town in NEBRASKA OR ANYWHERE ELSE DROP IN ANYTIME Til be sure to do that Burt thought dimly He ran past the sign like a sprinter closing on the tape and then swerved left crossing the road and kicked his loafers away Then he was in the corn and it closed behind him and over him like the waves of a green sea taking him in Hiding him He felt a sudden and wholly unexpected relief sweep him and at the same moment he got his second wind His lungs which had been shallowing up seemed to unlock and give him more breath He ran straight down the first row he had entered head ducked his broad shoulders swiping the leaves and making them tremble Twenty yards in he turned right parallel to the road again and ran on keeping low so they wouldn t see his dark head of hair bobbing amid the yellow corn tassels He doubled back toward the road for a few moments crossed more rows and then put his back to the road and hopped randomly from row to row always delving deeper and deeper into the corn At last he collapsed onto his knees and put his forehead against the ground He could only hear his own taxed breathing and the thought that played over and over in his mind was Thank God I gave up smoking thank God I gave up smoking thank God Then he could hear them yelling back and forth to each other in some cases bumping into each other Hey this is my row and the sound heartened him They were well away to his left and they sounded very poorly organized He took his handkerchief out of his shirt folded it and stuck it back in after looking at the wound The bleeding seemed to have stopped in spite of the workout he had given it He rested a moment longer and was suddenly aware that he felt good physically better than he had in years excepting the throb of his arm He felt well exercised and suddenly grappling with a clearcut no matter how insane problem after two years of trying to cope with the incubotic gremlins that were sucking his marriage dry It wasn t right that he should feel this way he told himself He was in deadly peril of his life and his wife had been carried off She might be dead now He tried to summon up Vicky s face and dispel some of the odd good feeling by doing so but her face wouldn t come What came was the red-haired boy with the knife in his throat He became aware of the corn fragrance in his nose now all around him The wind through the tops of the plants made a sound like voices Soothing Whatever had been done in the name of this corn it was now his protector But they were getting closer Running hunched over he hurried up the row he was in crossed over doubled back and crossed over more rows He tried to keep the voices always on his left but as the afternoon progressed that became harder and harder to do The voices had grown faint and often the rustling sound of the corn obscured them altogether He would run listen mn again The earth was hard-packed and his stockinged feet left little or no trace When he stopped much later the sun was hanging over the fields to his right red and inflamed and when he looked at his watch he saw that it was quarter past seven The sun had stained the corntops a reddish gold but here the shadows were dark and deep He cocked his head listening With the coming of sunset the wind had died entirely and the corn stood still exhaling its aroma of growth into the warm air If they were still in the corn they were either far away or just hunkered down and listening But Burt didn t think a bunch of kids even crazy ones could be quiet for that long He suspected they had done the most kidlike thing regardless of the consequences for them they had given up and gone home He turned toward the setting sun which had sunk between the raftered clouds on the horizon and began to walk If he cut on a diagonal through the rows always keeping the setting sun ahead of him he would be bound to strike Route sooner or later The ache in his arm had settled into a dull throb that was nearly pleasant and the good feeling was still with him He decided that as long as he was here he would let the good feeling exist in him without guilt The guilt would return when he had to face the authorities and account for what had happened in Gatlin But that could wait He pressed through the corn thinking he had never felt so keenly aware Fifteen minutes later the sun was only a hemisphere poking over the horizon and he stopped again his new awareness clicking into a pattern he didn t like It was vaguely well vaguely frightening He cocked his head The corn was rustling Burt had been aware of that for some time but he had just put it together with something else The wind was still How could that be He looked around warily half expecting to see the smiling boys in their Quaker coats creeping out of the corn their knives clutched in their hands Nothing of the sort There was still that rustling noise Off to the left He began to walk in that direction not having to bull through the corn anymore The row was taking him in the direction he wanted to go naturally The row ended up ahead Ended No emptied out into some sort of clearing The rustling was there He stopped suddenly afraid The scent of the corn was strong enough to be cloying The rows held onto the sun s heat and he became aware that he was plastered with sweat and chaff and thin spider strands of cornsilk The bugs ought to be crawling all over him but they weren t He stood still staring toward that place where the corn opened out onto what looked like a large circle of bare earth There were no minges or mosquitoes in here no blackflies or chiggers what he and Vicky had called drive-in bugs when they had been courting he thought with sudden and unexpectedly sad nostalgia And he hadn t seen a single crow How was that for weird a cornpatch with no crows In the last of the daylight he swept his eyes closely over the row of corn to his left And saw that every leaf and stalk was perfect which was just not possible No yellow blight No tattered leaves no caterpillar eggs no burrows no His eyes widened My God there aren t any weeds Not a single one Every foot and a half the corn plants rose from the earth There was no witchgrass jimson pikeweed whore s hair or poke salad Nothing Burt stared up eyes wide The light in the west was fading The raftered clouds had drawn back together Below them the golden light had faded to pink and ocher It would be dark soon enough It was time to go down to the clearing in the corn and see what was there hadn t that been the plan all along All the time he had thought he was cutting back to the highway hadn t he been being led to this place Dread in his belly he went on down to the row and stood at the edge of the clearing There was enough light left for him to see what was here He couldn t scream There didn t seem to be enough air left in his lungs He tottered in on legs like slats of splintery wood His eyes bulged from his sweaty face Vicky he whispered Oh Vicky my God She had been mounted on a crossbar like a hideous trophy her arms held at the wrists and her legs at the ankles with twists of common barbed wire seventy cents a yard at any hardware store in Nebraska Her eyes had been ripped out The sockets were filled with the moonflax of cornsilk Her jaws were wrenched open in a silent scream her mouth filled with cornhusks On her left was a skeleton in a moldering surplice The nude jawbone grinned The eye sockets seemed to stare at Burt jocularly as if the onetime minister of the Grace Baptist Church was saying It s not so bad being sacrificed by pagan devil-children in the corn is not so bad having your eyes ripped out of your skull according to the Laws of Moses is not so bad To the left of the skeleton in the surplice was a second skeleton this one dressed in a rotting blue uniform A hat hung over the skull shading the eyes and on the peak of the cap was a greenish-tinged badge reading police chief That was when Burt heard it coming not the children but something much larger moving through the corn and toward the clearing Not the children no The children wouldn t venture into the corn at night This was the holy place the place of He Who Walks Behind the Rows Jerkily Burt turned to flee The row he had entered the clearing by was gone Closed up All the rows had closed up It was coming closer now and he could hear it pushing through the corn He could hear it breathing An ecstasy of superstitious terror seized him It was coming The corn on the far side of the clearing had suddenly darkened as if a gigantic shadow had blotted it out Coming He Who Walks Behind the Rows It began to come into the clearing Burt saw something huge bulking up to the sky something green with terrible red eyes the size of footballs Something that smelled like dried cornhusks years in some dark barn He began to scream But he did not scream long Some time later a bloated orange harvest moon came up The children of the corn stood in the clearing at midday looking at the two crucified skeletons and the two bodies the bodies were not skeletons yet but they would be In time And here in the heartland of Nebraska in the corn there was nothing but time Behold a dream came to me in the night and the Lord did shew all this to me They all turned to look at Isaac with dread and wonder even Malachi Isaac was only nine but he had been the Seer since the corn had taken David a year ago David had been nineteen and he had walked into the corn on his birthday just as dusk had come drifting down the summer rows Now small face grave under his round-crowned hat Isaac continued And in my dream the Lord was a shadow that walked behind the rows and he spoke to me in the words he used to our older brothers years ago He is much displeased with this sacrifice They made a sighing sobbing noise and looked at the surrounding walls of green And the Lord did say Have I not given you a place of killing that you might make sacrifice there And have I not shewn you favor But this man has made a blasphemy within me and I have completed this sacrifice myself Like the Blue Man and the false minister who escaped many years ago The Blue Man the false minister they whispered and looked at each other uneasily So now is the Age of Favor lowered from nineteen plantings and harvestings to eighteen Isaac went on relentlessly Yet be fruitful and multiply as the corn multiplies that my favor may be shewn you and be upon you Isaac ceased The eyes turned to Malachi and Joseph the only two among this party who were eighteen There were others back in town perhaps twenty in all They waited to hear what Malachi would say Malachi who had led the hunt for Japheth who evermore would be known as Ahaz cursed of God Malachi had cut the throat of Ahaz and had thrown his body out of the corn so the foul body would not pollute it or blight it I obey the word of God Malachi whispered The corn seemed to sigh its approval In the weeks to come the girls would make many corncob crucifixes to ward off further evil And that night all of those now above the Age of Favor walked silently into the corn and went to the clearing to gain the continued favor of He Who Walks Behind the Rows Goodbye Malachi Ruth called She waved disconsolately Her belly was big with Malachi s child and tears coursed silently down her cheeks Malachi did not turn His back was straight The corn swallowed him Ruth turned away still crying She had conceived a secret hatred for the corn and sometimes dreamed of walking into it with a torch in each hand when dry September came and the stalks were dead and explosively combustile But she also feared it Out there in the night something walked and it saw everything even the secrets kept in human hearts Dusk deepened into night Around Gatlin the corn rustled and whispered secretly It was well pleased THE LAST RUNG ON THE LADDER I got Katrina s letter yesterday less than a week after my father and I got back from Los Angeles It was addressed to Wilmington Delaware and I d moved twice since then People move around so much now and it s funny how those crossed-off addresses and change-of-address stickers can look like accusations Her letter was rumpled and smudged one of the corners dog-eared from handling I read what was in it and the next thing I knew I was standing in the living room with the phone in my hand getting ready to call Dad I put the phone down with something like horror He was an old man and he d had two heart attacks Was I going to call him and tell about Katrina s letter so soon after we d been in L A To do that might very well have killed him So I didn t call And I had no one I could tell a thing like that letter it s too personal to tell anyone except a wife or a very close friend I haven t made many close friends in the last few years and my wife Helen and I divorced in What we exchange now are Christmas cards How are you How s the job Have a happy New Year I ve been awake all night with it with Katrina s letter She could have put it on a postcard There was only a single sentence below the Dear Larry But a sentence can mean enough It can do enough I remembered my dad on the plane his face seeming old and wasted in the harsh sunlight at feet as we went west from New York We had just passed over Omaha according to the pilot and Dad said It s a lot further away than it looks Larry There was a heavy sadness in his voice that made me uncomfortable because I couldn t understand it I understood it better after getting Katrina s letter We grew up eighty miles west of Omaha in a town called Hemingford Home my dad my mom my sister Katrina and me I was two years older than Katrina whom everyone called Kitty She was a beautiful child and a beautiful woman even at eight the year of the incident in the barn you could see that her cornsilk hair was never going to darken and that those eyes would always be a dark Scandinavian blue A look in those eyes and a man would be gone I guess you d say we grew up hicks My dad had three hundred acres of flat rich land and he grew feed corn and raised cattle Everybody just called it the home place In those days all the roads were dirt except Interstate and Nebraska Route and a trip to town was something you waited three days for Nowadays I m one of the best independent corporation lawyers in America so they tell me and I d have to admit for the sake of honesty that I think they re right A president of a large company once introduced me to his board of directors as his hired gun I wear expensive suits and my shoeleather is the best I ve got three assistants on full-time pay and I can call in another dozen if I need them But in those days I walked up a dirt road to a one-room school with books tied in a belt over my shoulder and Katrina walked with me Sometimes in the spring we went barefoot That was in the days before you couldn t get served in a diner or shop in a market unless you were wearing shoes Later on my mother died Katrina and I were in high school up at Columbia City then and two years after that my dad lost the place and went to work selling tractors It was the end of the family although that didn t seem so bad then Dad got along in his work bought himself a dealership and got tapped for a management position about nine years ago I got a football scholarship to the University of Nebraska and managed to learn something besides how to run the ball out of a slot-right formation And Katrina But it s her I want to tell you about It happened the barn thing one Saturday in early November To tell you the truth I can t pin down the actual year but Ike was still President Mom was at a bake fair in Columbia City and Dad had gone over to our nearest neighbor s and that was seven miles away to help the man fix a hayrake There was supposed to be a hired man on the place but he had never showed up that day and my dad fired him not a month later Dad left me a list of chores to do and there were some for Kitty too and told us not to get to playing until they were all done But that wasn t long It was November and by that time of year the make-or-break time had gone past We d made it again that year We wouldn t always I remember that day very clearly The sky was overcast and while it wasn t cold you could feel it wanting to be cold wanting to get down to the business of frost and freeze snow and sleet The fields were stripped The animals were sluggish and morose There seemed to be funny little drafts in the house that had never been there before On a day like that the only really nice place to be was the barn It was warm filled with a pleasant mixed aroma of hay and fur and dung and with the mysterious chuckling cooing sounds of the barnswallows high up in the third loft If you cricked your neck up you could see the white November light coming through the chinks in the roof and try to spell your name It was a game that really only seemed agreeable on over-cast autumn days There was a ladder nailed to a crossbeam high up in the third loft a ladder that went straight down to the main barn floor We were forbidden to climb on it because it was old and shaky Dad had promised Mom a thousand times that he would pull it down and put up a stronger one but something else always seemed to come up when there was time helping a neighbor with his hayrake for instance And the hired man was just not working out If you climbed up that rickety ladder there were exactly forty-three rungs Kitty and I had counted them enough to know you ended up on a beam that was seventy feet above the straw-littered barn floor And then if you edged out along the beam about twelve feet your knees jittering your ankle joints creaking your mouth dry and tasting like a used fuse you stood over the haymow And then you could jump off the beam and fall seventy feet straight down with a horrible hilarious dying swoop into a huge soft bed of lush hay It has a sweet smell hay does and you d come to rest in that smell of reborn summer with your stomach left behind you way up there in the middle of the air and you d feel well like Lazarus must have felt You had taken the fall and lived to tell the tale It was a forbidden sport all right If we had been caught my mother would have shrieked blue murder and my father would have laid on the strap even at our advanced ages Because of the ladder and because if you happened to lose your balance and topple from the beam before you had edged out over the loose fathoms of hay you would fall to utter destruction on the hard planking of the barn floor But the temptation was just too great When the cats are away well you know how that one goes That day started like all the others a delicious feeling of dread mixed with anticipation We stood at the foot of the ladder looking at each other Kitty s color was high her eyes darker and more sparkling than ever Dare you I said Promptly from Kitty Dares go first Promptly from me Girls go before boys Not if it s dangerous she said casting her eyes down demurely as if everybody didn t know she was the second-biggest tomboy in Hemingford But that was how she was about it She would go but she wouldn t go first Okay I said Here I go I was ten that year and thin as Scratch-the-demon about ninety pounds Kitty was eight and twenty pounds lighter The ladder had always held us before we thought it would always hold us again which is a philosophy that gets men and nations in trouble time after time I could feel it that day beginning to shimmy around a little bit in the dusty barn air as I climbed higher and higher As always about halfway up I entertained a vision of what would happen to me if it suddenly let go and gave up the ghost But I kept going until I was able to clap my hands around the beam and boost myself up and look down Kitty s face turned up to watch me was a small white oval In her faded checked shirt and blue denims she looked like a doll Above me still higher in the dusty reaches of the eaves the swallows cooed mellowly Again by rote Hi down there I called my voice floating down to her on motes of chaff Hi up there I stood up Swayed back and forth a little As always there seemed suddenly to be strange currents in the air that had not existed down below I could hear my own heartbeat as I began to inch along with my arms held out for balance Once a swallow had swooped close by my head during this part of the adventure and in drawing back I had almost lost my balance I lived in fear of the same thing happening again But not this time At last I stood above the safety of the hay Now looking down was not so much frightening as sensual There was a moment of anticipation Then I stepped off into space holding my nose for effect and as it always did the sudden grip of gravity yanking me down brutally making me plummet made me feel like yelling Oh I m sorry I made a mistake let me back up Then I hit the hay shot into it like a projectile its sweet and dusty smell billowing up around me still going down as if into heavy water coming slowly to rest buried in the stuff As always I could feel a sneeze building up in my nose And hear a frightened field mouse or two fleeing for a more serene section of the haymow And feel in that curious way that I had been reborn I remember Kitty telling me once that after diving into the hay she felt fresh and new like a baby I shrugged it off at the time sort of knowing what she meant sort of not knowing but since I got her letter I think about that too I climbed out of the hay sort of swimming through it until I could climb out onto the barn floor I had hay down my pants and down the back of my shirt It was on my sneakers and sticking to my elbows Hayseeds in my hair You bet She was halfway up the ladder by then her gold pigtails bouncing against her shoulderblades climbing through a dusty shaft of light On other days that light might have been as bright as her hair but on this day her pigtails had no competition they were easily the most colorful thing up there I remember thinking that I didn t like the way the ladder was swaying back and forth It seemed like it had never been so loosey-goosey Then she was on the beam high above me now I was the small one my face was the small white upturned oval as her voice floated down on errant chaff stirred up by my leap Hi down there Hi up there She edged along the beam and my heart loosened a little in my chest when I judged she was over the safety of the hay It always did although she was always more graceful than I was and more athletic if that doesn t sound like too strange a thing to say about your kid sister She stood poising on the toes of her old low-topped Keds hands out in front of her And then she swanned Talk about things you can t forget things you can t describe Well I can describe it in a way But not in a way that will make you understand how beautiful that was how perfect one of the few things in my life that seem utterly real utterly true No I can t tell you like that I don t have the skill with either my pen or my tongue For a moment she seemed to hang in the air as if borne up by one of those mysterious updrafts that only existed in the third loft a bright swallow with golden plumage such as Nebraska has never seen since She was Kitty my sister her arms swept behind her and her back arched and how I loved her for that beat of time Then she came down and plowed into the hay and out of sight An explosion of chaff and giggles rose out of the hole she made I d forgotten about how rickety the ladder had looked with her on it and by the time she was out I was halfway up again I tried to swan myself but the fear grabbed me the way it always did and my swan turned into a cannonball I think I never believed the hay was there the way Kitty believed it How long did the game go on Hard to tell But I looked up some ten or twelve dives later and saw the light had changed Our mom and dad were due back and we were all covered with chaff as good as a signed confession We agreed on one more turn each Going up first I felt the ladder moving beneath me and I could hear very faintly the whining rasp of old nails loosening up in the wood And for the first time I was really actively scared I think if I d been closer to the bottom I would have gone down and that would have been the end of it but the beam was closer and seemed safer Three rungs from the top the whine of pulling nails grew louder and I was suddenly cold with terror with the certainty that I had pushed it too far Then I had the splintery beam in my hands taking my weight off the ladder and there was a cold unpleasant sweat matting the twigs of hay to my forehead The fun of the game was gone I hurried out over the hay and dropped off Even the pleasurable part of the drop was gone Coming down I imagined how I d feel if that was solid barn planking coming up to meet me instead of the yielding give of the hay I came out to the middle of the barn to see Kitty hurrying up the ladder I called Hey come down It s not safe It ll hold me she called back confidently I m lighter than you Kitty But that never got finished Because that was when the ladder let go It went with a rotted splintering crack I cried out and Kitty screamed She was about where I had been when I d become convinced I d pressed my luck too far The rung she was standing on gave way and then both sides of the ladder split For a moment the ladder below her which had broken entirely free looked like a ponderous insect a praying mantis or a ladderbug which had just decided to walk off Then it toppled hitting the barn floor with a flat clap that raised dust and caused the cows to moo worriedly One of them kicked at its stall door Kitty uttered a high piercing scream Larry Larry Help me I knew what had to be done I saw right away I was terribly afraid but not quite scared out of my wits She was better than sixty feet above me her blue-jeaned legs kicking wildly at the blank air then barnswallows cooing above her I was scared all right And you know I still can t watch a circus aerial act not even on TV It makes my stomach feel weak But I knew what had to be done Kitty I bawled up at her Just hold still Hold still She obeyed me instantly Her legs stopped kicking and she hung straight down her small hands clutching the last rung on the ragged end of the ladder like an acrobat whose trapeze has stopped I ran to the haymow clutched up a double handful of the stuff ran back and dropped it I went back again And again And again I really don t remember it after that except the hay got up my nose and I started sneezing and couldn t stop I ran back and forth building a haystack where the foot of the ladder had been It was a very small haystack Looking at it then looking at her hanging so far above it you might have thought of one of those cartoons where the guy jumps three hundred feet into a water glass Back and forth Back and forth Larry I can t hold on much longer Her voice was high and despairing Kitty you ve got to You ve got to hold on Back and forth Hay down my shirt Back and forth The haystack was as high as my chin now but the haymow we had been diving into was twenty-five feet deep I thought that if she only broke her legs it would be getting off cheap And I knew if she missed the hay altogether she would be killed Back and forth Larry The rung It s letting go I could hear the steady rasping cry of the rung pulling free under her weight Her legs began to kick again in panic but if she was thrashing like that she would surely miss the hay No I yelled No Stop that Just let go Let go Kitty Because it was too late for me to get any more hay Too late for anything except blind hope She let go and dropped the second I told her to She came straight down like a knife It seemed to me that she dropped forever her gold pigtails standing straight up from her head her eyes shut her face as pale as china She didn t scream Her hands were locked in front of her lips as if she was praying And she struck the hay right in the center She went down out of sight in it hay flew up all around as if a shell had struck and I heard the thump of her body hitting the boards The sound a loud thud sent a deadly chill into me It had been too loud much too loud But I had to see Starting to cry I pounced on the haystack and pulled it apart flinging the straw behind me in great handfuls Ablue-jeaned leg came to light then a plaid shirt and then Kitty s face It was deadly pale and her eyes were shut She was dead I knew it as I looked at her The world went gray for me November gray The only things in it with any color were her pigtails bright gold And then the deep blue of her irises as she opened her eyes Kitty My voice was hoarse husky unbelieving My throat was coated with haychaff Kitty Larry she asked bewildered Am I alive I picked her out of the hay and hugged her and she put her arms around my neck and hugged me back You re alive I said You re alive you re alive She had broken her left ankle and that was all When Dr Pedersen the GP from Columbia City came out to the barn with my father and me he looked up into the shadows for a long time The last rung on the ladder still hung there aslant from one nail He looked as I said for a long time A miracle he said to my father and then kicked disdainfully at the hay I d put down He went out to his dusty DeSoto and drove away My father s hand came down on my shoulder We re going to the woodshed Larry he said in a very calm voice I believe you know what s going to happen there Yes sir I whispered Every time I whack you Larry I want you to thank God your sister is still alive Yes sir Then we went He whacked me plenty of times so many times I ate standing up for a week and with a cushion on my chair for two weeks after that And every time he whacked me with his big red callused hand I thanked God In a loud loud voice By the last two or three whacks I was pretty sure He was hearing me They let me in to see her just before bedtime There was a catbird outside her window I remember that Her foot all wrapped up was propped on a board She looked at me so long and so lovingly that I was uncomfortable Then she said Hay You put down hay Course I did I blurted What else would I do Once the ladder broke there was no way to get up there I didn t know what you were doing she said You must have I was right under you for cripe s sake I didn t dare look down she said I was too scared I had my eyes shut the whole time I stared at her thunderstruck You didn t know Didn t know what I was doing She shook her head And when I told you to let go you you just did it She nodded Kitty how could you do that She looked at me with those deep blue eyes I knew you must have been doing something to fix it she said You re my big brother I knew you d take care of me Oh Kitty you don t know how close it was I had put my hands over my face She sat up and took them away She kissed my cheek No she said But I knew you were down there Gee am I sleepy I ll see you tomorrow Larry I m going to have a cast Dr Pedersen says She had the cast on for a little less than a month and all her classmates signed it she even got me to sign it And when it came off that was the end of the barn incident My father replaced the ladder up to the third loft with a new strong one but I never climbed up to the beam and jumped off into the haymow again So far as I know Kitty didn t either It was the end but somehow not the end Somehow it never ended until nine days ago when Kitty jumped from the top story of an insurance building in Los Angeles I have the clipping from The L A Times in my wallet I guess I ll always carry it not in the good way you carry snapshots of people you want to remember or theater tickets from a really good show or part of the program from a World Series game I carry that clipping the way you carry something heavy because carrying it is your work The headline reads CALL GIRL SWAN-DIVES TO HER DEATH We grew up That s all I know other than facts that don t mean anything She was going to go to business college in Omaha but in the summer after she graduated from high school she won a beauty contest and married one of the judges It sounds like a dirty joke doesn t it My Kitty While I was in law school she got divorced and wrote me a long letter ten pages or more telling me how it had been how messy it had been how it might have been better if she could have had a child She asked me if I could come But losing a week in law school is like losing a term in liberal-arts undergraduate Those guys are greyhounds If you lose sight of the little mechanical rabbit it s gone forever She moved to L A and got married again When that one broke up I was out of law school There was another letter a shorter one more bitter She was never going to get stuck on that merry-go-round she told me It was a fix job The only way you could catch the brass ring was to tumble off the horse and crack your skull If that was what the price of a free ride was who wanted it PS Can you come Larry It s been a while I wrote back and told her I d love to come but I couldn t I had landed a job in a high- pressure firm low guy on the totem pole all the work and none of the credit If I was going to make it up to the next step it would have to be that year That was my long letter and it was all about my career I answered all of her letters But I could never really believe that it was really Kitty who was writing them you know no more than I could really believe that the hay was really there until it broke my fall at the bottom of the drop and saved my life I couldn t believe that my sister and the beaten woman who signed Kitty in a circle at the bottom of her letters were really the same person My sister was a girl with pigtails still without breasts She was the one who stopped writing I d get Christmas cards birthday cards and my wife would reciprocate Then we got divorced and I moved and just forgot The next Christmas and the birthday after the cards came through the forwarding address The first one And I kept thinking Gee I ve got to write Kitty and tell her that I ve moved But I never did But as I ve told you those are facts that don t mean anything The only things that matter are that we grew up and she swanned from that insurance building and that Kitty was the one who always believed the hay would be there Kitty was the one who had said I knew you must be doing something to fix it Those things matter And Kitty s letter People move around so much now and it s funny how those crossed-off addresses and change-of-address stickers can look like accusations She d printed her return address in the upper left corner of the envelope the place she d been staying at until she jumped A very nice apartment building on Van Nuys Dad and I went there to pick up her things The landlady was nice She had liked Kitty The letter was postmarked two weeks before she died It would have gotten to me a long time before if not for the forwarding addresses She must have gotten tired of waiting Dear Larry I ve been thinking about it a lot lately and what I ve decided is that it would have been better for me if that last rung had broken before you could put the hay down Your Kitty Yes I guess she must have gotten tired of waiting I d rather believe that than think of her deciding I must have forgotten I wouldn t want her to think that because that one sentence was maybe the only thing that would have brought me on the run But not even that is the reason sleep comes so hard now When I close my eyes and start to drift off I see her coming down from the third loft her eyes wide and dark blue her body arched her arms swept up behind her She was the one who always knew the hay would be there THE MAN WHO LOVED FLOWERS On an early evening in May of a young man with his hand in his pocket walked briskly up New York s Third Avenue The air was soft and beautiful the sky was darkening by slow degrees from blue to the calm and lovely violet of dusk There are people who love the city and this was one of the nights that made them love it Everyone standing in the doorways of the delicatessens and dry-cleaning shops and restaurants seemed to be smiling An old lady pushing two bags of groceries in an old baby pram grinned at the young man and hailed him Hey beautiful The young man gave her a half-smile and raised his hand in a wave She passed on her way thinking He s in love He had that look about him He was dressed in a light gray suit the narrow tie pulled down a little his top collar button undone His hair was dark and cut short His complexion was fair his eyes a light blue Not an extraordinary face but on this soft spring evening on this avenue in May of he was beautiful and the old woman found herself thinking with a moment s sweet nostalgia that in spring anyone can be beautiful if they re hurrying to meet the one of their dreams for dinner and maybe dancing after Spring is the only season when nostalgia never seems to turn bitter and she went on her way glad that she had spoken to him and glad he had returned the compliment by raising his hand in half-salute The young man crossed Sixty-third Street walking with a bounce in his step and that same half-smile on his lips Partway up the block an old man stood beside a chipped green handcart filled with flowers the predominant color was yellow a yellow fever of jonquils and late crocuses The old man also had carnations and a few hothouse tea roses mostly yellow and white He was eating a pretzel and listening to a bulky transistor radio that was sitting kitty-corner on his handcart The radio poured out bad news that no one listened to a hammer murderer was still on the loose JFK had declared that the situation in a little Asian country called Vietnam Vitenum the guy reading the news call it would bear watching an unidentified woman had been pulled from the East River a grand jury had failed to indict a crime overlord in the current city administration s war on heroin the Russians had exploded a nuclear device None of it seemed real none of it seemed to matter The air was soft and sweet Two men with beer bellies stood outside a bakery pitching nickels and ribbing each other Spring trembled on the edge of summer and in the city summer is the season of dreams The young man passed the flower stand and the sound of the bad news faded He hesitated looked over his shoulder and thought it over He reached into his coat pocket and touched the something in there again For a moment his face seemed puzzled lonely almost haunted and then as his hand left the pocket it regained its former expression of eager expectation He turned back to the flower stand smiling He would bring her some flowers that would please her He loved to see her eyes light up with surprise and joy when he brought her a surprise little things because he was far from rich A box of candy A bracelet Once only a bag of Valencia oranges because he knew they were Norma s favorite My young friend the flower vendor said as the man in the gray suit came back running his eyes over the stock in the handcart The vendor was maybe sixty-eight wearing a torn gray knitted sweater and a soft cap in spite of the warmth of the evening His face was a map of wrinkles his eyes were deep in pouches and a cigarette jittered between his fingers But he also remembered how it was to be young in the spring young and so much in love that you practically zoomed everywhere The vendor s face was normally sour but now he smiled a little just as the old woman pushing the groceries had because this guy was such an obvious case He brushed pretzel crumbs from the front of his baggy sweater and thought If this kid were sick they d have him in intensive care right now How much are your flowers the young man asked I ll make you up a nice bouquet for a dollar Those tea roses they re hothouse Cost a little more seventy cents apiece I sell you half a dozen for three dollars and fifty cents Expensive the young man said Nothing good comes cheap my young friend Didn t your mother ever teach you that The young man grinned She might have mentioned it at that Sure Sure she did I give you half a dozen two red two yellow two white Can t do no better than that can I Put in some baby s breath they love that and fill it out with some fern Nice Or you can have the bouquet for a dollar They the young man asked still smiling My young friend the flower vendor said flicking his cigarette butt into the gutter and returning the smile no one buys flowers for themselves in May It s like a national law you understand what I mean The young man thought of Norma her happy surprised eyes and her gentle smile and he ducked his head a little I guess I do at that he said Sure you do What do you say Well what do you think I m gonna tell you what I think Hey Advice is still free isn t it The young man smiled and said I guess it s the only thing left that is You re damn tooting it is the flower vendor said Okay my young friend If the flowers are for your mother you get her the bouquet A few jonquils a few crocuses some lily of the valley She don t spoil it by saying Oh Junior I love them how much did they cost oh that s too much don t you know enough not to throw your money around The young man threw his head back and laughed The vendor said But if it s your girl that s a different thing my son and you know it You bring her the tea roses and she don t turn into an accountant you take my meaning Hey She s gonna throw her arms around your neck I ll take the tea roses the young man said and this time it was the flower vendor s turn to laugh The two men pitching nickels glanced over smiling Hey kid one of them called You wanna buy a weddin ring cheap I ll sell you mine I don t want it no more The young man grinned and blushed to the roots of his dark hair The flower vendor picked out six tea roses snipped the stems a little spritzed them with water and wrapped them in a large conical spill Tonight s weather looks just the way you d want it the radio said Fair and mild temps in the mid to upper sixties perfect for a little rooftop stargazing if you re the romantic type Enjoy Greater New York enjoy The flower vendor Scotch-taped the seam of the paper spill and advised the young man to tell his lady that a little sugar added to the water she put them in would preserve them longer I ll tell her the young man said He held out a five-dollar bill Thank you Just doing the job my young friend the vendor said giving him a dollar and two quarters His smile grew a bit sad Give her a kiss for me On the radio the Four Seasons began singing Sherry The young man pocketed his change and went on up the street eyes wide and alert and eager looking not so much around him at the life ebbing and flowing up and down Third Avenue as inward and ahead anticipating But certain things did impinge a mother pulling a baby in a wagon the baby s face comically smeared with ice cream a little girl jumping rope and singsonging out her rhyme Betty and Henry up in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G First comes love then comes marriage here comes Henry with a baby carriage Two women stood outside a washateria smoking and comparing pregnancies A group of men were looking in a hardware-store window at a gigantic color TV with a four-figure price tag a baseball game was on and all the players faces looked green The playing field was a vague strawberry color and the New York Mets were leading the Phillies by a score of six to one in the top of the ninth He walked on carrying the flowers unaware that the two women outside the washateria had stopped talking for a moment and had watched him wistfully as he walked by with his paper of tea roses their days of receiving flowers were long over He was unaware of a young traffic cop who stopped the cars at the intersection of Third and Sixty-ninth with a blast on his whistle to let him cross the cop was engaged himself and recognized the dreamy expression on the young man s face from his own shaving mirror where he had often seen it lately He was unaware of the two teen-aged girls who passed him going the other way and then clutched themselves and giggled At Seventy-third Street he stopped and turned right This street was a little darker lined with brownstones and walk-down restaurants with Italian names Three blocks down a stickball game was going on in the fading light The young man did not go that far half a block down he turned into a narrow lane Now the stars were out gleaming softly and the lane was dark and shadowy lined with vague shapes of garbage cans The young man was alone now no not quite A wavering yowl rose in the purple gloom and the young man frowned It was some tomcat s love song and there was nothing pretty about that He walked more slowly and glanced at his watch It was quarter of eight and Norma should be just Then he saw her coming toward him from the courtyard wearing dark blue slacks and a sailor blouse that made his heart ache It was always a surprise seeing her for the first time it was always a sweet shock she looked so young Now his smile shone out radiated out and he walked faster Norma he said She looked up and smiled but as they drew together the smile faded His own smile trembled a little and he felt a moment s disquiet Her face over the sailor blouse suddenly seemed blurred It was getting dark now could he have been mistaken Surely not It was Norma I brought you flowers he said in a happy relief and handed the paper spill to her She looked at them for a moment smiled and handed them back Thank you but you re mistaken she said My name is Norma he whispered and pulled the short-handled hammer out of his coat pocket where it had been all along They re for you Norma it was always for you all for you She backed away her face a round white blur her mouth an opening black O of terror and she wasn t Norma Norma was dead she had been dead for ten years and it didn t matter because she was going to scream and he swung the hammer to stop the scream to kill the scream and as he swung the hammer the spill of flowers fell out of his hand the spill spilled and broke open spilling red white and yellow tea roses beside the dented trash cans where cats made alien love in the dark screaming in love screaming screaming He swung the hammer and she didn t scream but she might scream because she wasn t Norma none of them were Norma and he swung the hammer swung the hammer swung the hammer She wasn t Norma and so he swung the hammer as he had done five other times Some unknown time later he slipped the hammer back into his inner coat pocket and backed away from the dark shadow sprawled on the cobblestones away from the litter of tea roses by the garbage cans He turned and left the narrow lane It was full dark now The stickball players had gone in If there were bloodstains on his suit they wouldn t show not in the dark not in the soft late spring dark and her name had not been Norma but he knew what his name was It was was Love His name was love and he walked these dark streets because Norma was waiting for him And he would find her Someday soon He began to smile A bounce came into his step as he walked on down Seventy-third Street A middle-aged married couple sitting on the steps of their building watched him go by head cocked eyes far away a half-smile on his lips When he had passed by the woman said How come you never look that way anymore Huh Nothing she said but she watched the young man in the gray suit disappear into the gloom of the encroaching night and thought that if there was anything more beautiful than springtime it was young love ONE FOR THE ROAD It was quarter past ten and Herb Tooklander was thinking of closing for the night when the man in the fancy overcoat and the white staring face burst into Tookey s Bar which lies in the northern part of Falmouth It was the tenth of January just about the time most folks are learning to live comfortably with all the New Year s resolutions they broke and there was one hell of a northeaster blowing outside Six inches had come down before dark and it had been going hard and heavy since then Twice we had seen Billy Larribee go by high in the cab of the town plow and the second time Tookey ran him out a beer an act of pure charity my mother would have called it and my God knows she put down enough of Tookey s beer in her time Billy told him they were keeping ahead of it on the main road but the side ones were closed and apt to stay that way until next morning The radio in Portland was forecasting another foot and a forty-mile-an-hour wind to pile up the drifts There was just Tookey and me in the bar listening to the wind howl around the eaves and watching it dance the fire around on the hearth Have one for the road Booth Tookey says I m gonna shut her down He poured me one and himself one and that s when the door cracked open and this stranger staggered in snow up to his shoulders and in his hair like he had rolled around in confectioner s sugar The wind billowed a sand-fine sheet of snow in after him Close the door Tookey roars at him Was you born in a barn I ve never seen a man who looked that scared He was like a horse that s spent an afternoon eating fire nettles His eyes rolled toward Tookey and he said My wife my daughter and he collapsed on the floor in a dead faint Holy Joe Tookey says Close the door Booth would you I went and shut it and pushing it against the wind was something of a chore Tookey was down on one knee holding the fellow s head up and patting his cheeks I got over to him and saw right off that it was nasty His face was fiery red but there were gray blotches here and there and when you ve lived through winters in Maine since the time Woodrow Wilson was President as I have you know those gray blotches mean frostbite Fainted Tookey said Get the brandy off the backbar will you I got it and came back Tookey had opened the fellow s coat He had come around a little his eyes were half open and he was muttering something too low to catch Pour a capful Tookey says Just a cap I asks him That stuffs dynamite Tookey says No sense overloading his carb I poured out a capful and looked at Tookey He nodded Straight down the hatch I poured it down It was a remarkable thing to watch The man trembled all over and began to cough His face got redder His eyelids which had been at half-mast flew up like window shades I was a bit alarmed but Tookey only sat him up like a big baby and clapped him on the back The man started to retch and Tookey clapped him again Hold onto it he says that brandy comes dear The man coughed some more but it was diminishing now I got my first good look at him City fellow all right and from somewhere south of Boston at a guess He was wearing kid gloves expensive but thin There were probably some more of those grayish- white patches on his hands and he would be lucky not to lose a finger or two His coat was fancy all right a three-hundred-dollar job if ever I d seen one He was wearing tiny little boots that hardly came up over his ankles and I began to wonder about his toes Better he said All right Tookey said Can you come over to the fire My wife and my daughter he said They re out there in the storm From the way you came in I didn t figure they were at home watching the TV Tookey said You can tell us by the fire as easy as here on the floor Hook on Booth He got to his feet but a little groan came out of him and his mouth twisted down in pain I wondered about his toes again and I wondered why God felt he had to make fools from New York City who would try driving around in southern Maine at the height of a northeast blizzard And I wondered if his wife and his little girl were dressed any warmer than him We hiked him across to the fireplace and got him sat down in a rocker that used to be Missus Tookey s favorite until she passed on in It was Missus Tookey that was responsible for most of the place which had been written up in Down East and the Sunday Telegram and even once in the Sunday supplement of the Boston Globe It s really more of a public house than a bar with its big wooden floor pegged together rather than nailed the maple bar the old barn-raftered ceiling and the monstrous big fieldstone hearth Missus Tookey started to get some ideas in her head after the Down East article came out wanted to start calling the place Tookey s Inn or Tookey s Rest and I admit it has sort of a Colonial ring to it but I prefer plain old Tookey s Bar It s one thing to get uppish in the summer when the state s full of tourists another thing altogether in the winter when you and your neighbors have to trade together And there had been plenty of winter nights like this one that Tookey and I had spent all alone together drinking scotch and water or just a few beers My own Victoria passed on in and Tookey s was a place to go where there were enough voices to mute the steady ticking of the deathwatch beetle even if there was just Tookey and me it was enough I wouldn t have felt the same about it if the place had been Tookey s Rest It s crazy but it s true We got this fellow in front of the fire and he got the shakes harder than ever He hugged onto his knees and his teeth clattered together and a few drops of clear mucus spilled off the end of his nose I think he was starting to realize that another fifteen minutes out there might have been enough to kill him It s not the snow it s the wind-chill factor It steals your heat Where did you go off the road Tookey asked him S-six miles s-s-south of h-here he said Tookey and I stared at each other and all of a sudden I felt cold Cold all over You sure Tookey demanded You came six miles through the snow He nodded I checked the odometer when we came through t-town I was following directions going to see my wife s s-sister in Cumberland never been there before we re from New Jersey New Jersey If there s anyone more purely foolish than a New Yorker it s a fellow from New Jersey Six miles you re sure Tookey demanded Pretty sure yeah I found the turnoff but it was drifted in it was Tookey grabbed him In the shifting glow of the fire his face looked pale and strained older than his sixty-six years by ten You made a right turn Right turn yeah My wife Did you see a sign Sign He looked up at Tookey blankly and wiped the end of his nose Of course I did It was on my instructions Take Jointner Avenue through Jerusalem s Lot to the entrance ramp He looked from Tookey to me and back to Tookey again Outside the wind whistled and howled and moaned through the eaves Wasn t that right mister The Lot Tookey said almost too soft to hear Oh my God What s wrong the man said His voice was rising Wasn t that right I mean the road looked drifted in but I thought if there s a town there the plows will be out and and then I He just sort of tailed off Booth Tookey said to me low Get on the phone Call the sheriff Sure this fool from New Jersey says that s right What s wrong with you guys anyway You look like you saw a ghost Tookey said No ghosts in the Lot mister Did you tell them to stay in the car Sure I did he said sounding injured I m not crazy Well you couldn t have proved it by me What s your name I asked him For the sheriff Lumley he says Gerard Lumley He started in with Tookey again and I went across to the telephone I picked it up and heard nothing but dead silence I hit the cutoff buttons a couple of times Still nothing I came back Tookey had poured Gerard Lumley another tot of brandy and this one was going down him a lot smoother Was he out Tookey asked Phone s dead Hot damn Tookey says and we look at each other Outside the wind gusted up throwing snow against the windows Lumley looked from Tookey to me and back again Well haven t either of you got a car he asked The anxiety was back in his voice They ve got to run the engine to run the heater I only had about a quarter of a tank of gas and it took me an hour and a half to Look will you answer me He stood up and grabbed Tookey s shirt Mister Tookey says I think your hand just ran away from your brains there Lumley looked at his hand at Tookey then dropped it Maine he hissed He made it sound like a dirty word about somebody s mother All right he said Where s the nearest gas station They must have a tow truck Nearest gas station is in Falmouth Center I said That s three miles down the road from here Thanks he said a bit sarcastic and headed for the door buttoning his coat Won t be open though I added He turned back slowly and looked at us What are you talking about old man He s trying to tell you that the station in the Center belongs to Billy Larribee and Billy s out driving the plow you damn fool Tookey says patiently Now why don t you come back here and sit down before you bust a gut He came back looking dazed and frightened Are you telling me you can t that there isn t I ain t telling you nothing Tookey says You re doing all the telling and if you stopped for a minute we could think this over What s this town Jerusalem s Lot he asked Why was the road drifted in And no lights on anywhere I said Jerusalem s Lot burned out two years back And they never rebuilt He looked like he didn t believe it It appears that way I said and looked at Tookey What are we going to do about this Can t leave them out there he said I got closer to him Lumley had wandered away to look out the window into the snowy night What if they ve been got at I asked That may be he said But we don t know it for sure I ve got my Bible on the shelf You still wear your Pope s medal I pulled the crucifix out of my shirt and showed him I was born and raised Congregational but most folks who live around the Lot wear something crucifix St Christopher s medal rosary something Because two years ago in the span of one dark October month the Lot went bad Sometimes late at night when there were just a few regulars drawn up around Tookey s fire people would talk it over Talk around it is more like the truth You see people in the Lot started to disappear First a few then a few more than a whole slew The schools closed The town stood empty for most of a year Oh a few people moved in mostly damn fools from out of state like this fine specimen here drawn by the low property values I suppose But they didn t last A lot of them moved out a month or two after they d moved in The others well they disappeared Then the town burned flat It was at the end of a long dry fall They figure it started up by the Marsten House on the hill that overlooked Jointner Avenue but no one knows how it started not to this day It burned out of control for three days After that for a time things were better And then they started again I only heard the word vampires mentioned once A crazy pulp truck driver named Richie Messina from over Freeport way was in Tookey s that night pretty well liquored up Jesus Christ this stampeder roars standing up about nine feet tall in his wool pants and his plaid shirt and his leather-topped boots Are you all so damn afraid to say it out Vampires That s what you re all thinking ain t it Jesus-jumped-up-Christ in a chariot- driven sidecar Just like a bunch of kids scared of the movies You know what there is down there in Salem s Lot Want me to tell you Want me to tell you Do tell Richie Tookey says It had got real quiet in the bar You could hear the fire popping and outside the soft drift of November rain coming down in the dark You got the floor What you got over there is your basic wild dog pack Richie Messina tells us That s what you got That and a lot of old women who love a good spook story Why for eighty bucks I d go up there and spend the night in what s left of that haunted house you re all so worried about Well what about it Anyone want to put it up But nobody would Richie was a loudmouth and a mean drunk and no one was going to shed any tears at his wake but none of us were willing to see him go into Salem s Lot after dark Be screwed to the bunch of you Richie says I got my four-ten in the trunk of my Chevy and that ll stop anything in Falmouth Cumberland or Jerusalem s Lot And that s where I m goin He slammed out of the bar and no one said a word for a while Then Lamont Henry says real quiet That s the last time anyone s gonna see Richie Messina Holy God And Lamont raised to be a Methodist from his mother s knee crossed himself He ll sober off and change his mind Tookey said but he sounded uneasy He ll be back by closin time makin out it was all a joke But Lamont had the right of that one because no one ever saw Richie again His wife told the state cops she thought he d gone to Florida to beat a collection agency but you could see the truth of the thing in her eyes sick scared eyes Not long after she moved away to Rhode Island Maybe she thought Richie was going to come after her some dark night And I m not the man to say he might not have done Now Tookey was looking at me and I was looking at Tookey as I stuffed my crucifix back into my shirt I never felt so old or so scared in my life Tookey said again We can t just leave them out there Booth Yeah I know We looked at each other for a moment longer and then he reached out and gripped my shoulder You re a good man Booth That was enough to buck me up some It seems like when you pass seventy people start forgetting that you are a man or that you ever were Tookey walked over to Lumley and said I ve got a four-wheel-drive Scout I ll get it out For God s sake man why didn t you say so before He had whirled around from the window and was staring angrily at Tookey Why d you have to spend ten minutes beating around the bush Tookey said very softly Mister you shut your jaw And if you get urge to open it you remember who made that turn onto an unplowed road in the middle of a goddamned blizzard He started to say something and then shut his mouth Thick color had risen up in his cheeks Tookey went out to get his Scout out of the garage I felt around under the bar for his chrome flask and filled it full of brandy Figured we might need it before this night was over Maine blizzard ever been out in one The snow comes flying so thick and fine that it looks like sand and sounds like that beating on the sides of your car or pickup You don t want to use your high beams because they reflect off the snow and you can t see ten feet in front of you With the low beams on you can see maybe fifteen feet But I can live with the snow It s the wind I don t like when it picks up and begins to howl driving the snow into a hundred weird flying shapes and sounding like all the hate and pain and fear in the world There s death in the throat of a snowstorm wind white death and maybe something beyond death That s no sound to hear when you re tucked up all cozy in your own bed with the shutters bolted and the doors locked It s that much worse if you re driving And we were driving smack into Salem s Lot Hurry up a little can t you Lumley asked I said For a man who came in half frozen you re in one hell of a hurry to end up walking again He gave me a resentful baffled look and didn t say anything else We were moving up the highway at a steady twenty-five miles an hour It was hard to believe that Billy Larribee had just plowed this stretch an hour ago another two inches had covered it and it was drifting in The strongest gusts of wind rocked the Scout on her springs The headlights showed a swirling white nothing up ahead of us We hadn t met a single car About ten minutes later Lumley gasps Hey What s that He was pointing out my side of the car I d been looking dead ahead I turned but was a shade too late I thought I could see some sort of slumped form fading back from the car back into the snow but that could have been imagination What was it A deer I asked I guess so he says sounding shaky But its eyes they looked red He looked at me Is that how a deer s eyes look at night He sounded almost as if he were pleading They can look like anything I says thinking that might be true but I ve seen a lot of deer at night from a lot of cars and never saw any set of eyes reflect back red Tookey didn t say anything About fifteen minutes later we came to a place where the snowbank on the right of the road wasn t so high because the plows are supposed to raise their blades a little when they go through an intersection This looks like where we turned Lumley said not sounding too sure about it I don t see the sign This is it Tookey answered He didn t sound like himself at all You can just see the top of the signpost Oh Sure Lumley sounded relieved Listen Mr Tooklander I m sorry about being so short back there I was cold and worried and calling myself two hundred kinds of fool And I want to thank you both Don t thank Booth and me until we ve got them in this car Tookey said He put the Scout in four-wheel drive and slammed his way through the snowbank and onto Jointner Avenue which goes through the Lot and out to Snow flew up from the mudguards The rear end tried to break a little bit but Tookey s been driving through snow since Hector was a pup He jockeyed it a bit talked to it and on we went The headlights picked out the bare indication of other tire tracks from time to time the ones made by Lumley s car and then they would disappear again Lumley was leaning forward looking for his car And all at once Tookey said Mr Lumley What He looked around at Tookey People around these parts are kind of superstitious about Salem s Lot Tookey says sounding easy enough but I could see the deep lines of strain around his mouth and the way his eyes kept moving from side to side If your people are in the car why that s fine We ll pack them up go back to my place and tomorrow when the storm s over Billy will be glad to yank your car out of the snowbank But if they re not in the car Not in the car Lumley broke in sharply Why wouldn t they be in the car If they re not in the car Tookey goes on not answering we re going to turn around and drive back to Falmouth Center and whistle for the sheriff Makes no sense to go wallowing around at night in a snowstorm anyway does it They ll be in the car Where else would they be I said One other thing Mr Lumley If we should see anybody we re not going to talk to them Not even if they talk to us You understand that Very slow Lumley says Just what are these superstitions Before I could say anything God alone knows what I would have said Tookey broke in We re there We were coming up on the back end of a big Mercedes The whole hood of the thing was buried in a snowdrift and another drift had socked in the whole left side of the car But the taillights were on and we could see exhaust drifting out of the tailpipe They didn t run out of gas anyway Lumley said Tookey pulled up and pulled on the Scout s emergency brake You remember what Booth told you Lumley Sure sure But he wasn t thinking of anything but his wife and daughter I don t see how anybody could blame him either Ready Booth Tookey asked me His eyes held on mine grim and gray in the dashboard lights I guess I am I said We all got out and the wind grabbed us throwing snow in our faces Lumley was first bending into the wind his fancy topcoat billowing out behind him like a sail He cast two shadows one from Tookey s headlights the other from his own taillights I was behind him and Tookey was a step behind me When I got to the trunk of the Mercedes Tookey grabbed me Let him go he said Janey Francie Lumley yelled Everything okay He pulled open the driver s-side door and leaned in Everything He froze to a dead stop The wind ripped the heavy door right out of his hand and pushed it all the way open Holy God Booth Tookey said just below the scream of the wind I think it s happened again Lumley turned back toward us His face was scared and bewildered his eyes wide All of a sudden he lunged toward us through the snow slipping and almost falling He brushed me away like I was nothing and grabbed Tookey How did you know he roared Where are they What the hell is going on here Tookey broke his grip and shoved past him He and I looked into the Mercedes together Warm as toast it was but it wasn t going to be for much longer The little amber low-fuel light was glowing The big car was empty There was a child s Barbie doll on the passenger s floormat And a child s ski parka was crumpled over the seatback Tookey put his hands over his face and then he was gone Lumley had grabbed him and shoved him right back into the snowbank His face was pale and wild His mouth was working as if he had chewed down on some bitter stuff he couldn t yet unpucker enough to spit out He reached in and grabbed the parka Francie s coat he kind of whispered And then loud bellowing Francie s coat He turned around holding it in front of him by the little fur-trimmed hood He looked at me blank and unbelieving She can t be out without her coat on Mr Booth Why why she ll freeze to death Mr Lumley He blundered past me still holding the parka shouting Francie Janey Where are you Where are youuu I gave Tookey my hand and pulled him onto his feet Are you all Never mind me he says We ve got to get hold of him Booth We went after him as fast as we could which wasn t very fast with the snow hip-deep in some places But then he stopped and we caught up to him Mr Lumley Tookey started laying a hand on his shoulder This way Lumley said This is the way they went Look We looked down We were in a kind of dip here and most of the wind went right over our heads And you could see two sets of tracks one large and one small just filling up with snow If we had been five minutes later they would have been gone He started to walk away his head down and Tookey grabbed him back No No Lumley Lumley turned his wild face up to Tookey s and made a fist He drew it back but something in Tookey s face made him falter He looked from Tookey to me and then back again She ll freeze he said as if we were a couple of stupid kids Don t you get it She doesn t have her jacket on and she s only seven years old They could be anywhere Tookey said You can t follow those tracks They ll be gone in the next drift What do you suggest Lumley yells his voice high and hysterical If we go back to get the police she ll freeze to death Francie and my wife They may be frozen already Tookey said His eyes caught Lumley s Frozen or something worse What do you mean Lumley whispered Get it straight goddamn it Tell me Mr Lumley Tookey says there s something in the Lot But I was the one who came out with it finally said the word I never expected to say Vampires Mr Lumley Jerusalem s Lot is full of vampires I expect that s hard for you to swallow He was staring at me as if I d gone green Loonies he whispers You re a couple of loonies Then he turned away cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed FRANCIE JANEY He started floundering off again The snow was up to the hem of his fancy coat I looked at Tookey What do we do now Follow him Tookey says His hair was plastered with snow and he did look a little bit loony I can t just leave him out here Booth Can you No I says Guess not So we started to wade through the snow after Lumley as best we could But he kept getting further and further ahead He had his youth to spend you see He was breaking the trail going through that snow like a bull My arthritis began to bother me something terrible and I started to look down at my legs telling myself A little further just a little further keep goin damn it keep goin I piled right into Tookey who was standing spread-legged in a drift His head was hanging and both of his hands were pressed to his chest Tookey I says you okay I m all right he said taking his hands away We ll stick with him Booth and when he fags out he ll see reason We topped a rise and there was Lumley at the bottom looking desperately for more tracks Poor man there wasn t a chance he was going to find them The wind blew straight across down there where he was and any tracks would have been rubbed out three minutes after they was made let alone a couple of hours He raised his head and screamed into the night FRANCIE JAdSfEY FOR GOD S SAlKE And you could hear the desperation in his voice the terror and pity him for it The only answer he got was the freight-train wail of the wind It almost seemed to be laughin at him saying I took them Mister New Jersey with your fancy car and camel s- hair topcoat I took them and I rubbed out their tracks and by morning I ll have them just as neat and frozen as two strawberries in a deepfreeze Lumley Tookey bawled over the wind Listen you never mind vampires or boogies or nothing like that but you mind this You re just making it worse for them We got to get the And then there was an answer a voice coming out of the dark like little tinkling silver bells and my heart turned cold as ice in a cistern Jerry Jerry is that you Lumley wheeled at the sound And then she came drifting out of the dark shadows of a little copse of trees like a ghost She was a city woman all right and right then she seemed like the most beautiful woman I had ever seen I felt like I wanted to go to her and tell her how glad I was she was safe after all She was wearing a heavy green pullover sort of thing a poncho I believe they re called It floated all around her and her dark hair streamed out in the wild wind like water in a December creek just before the winter freeze stills it and locks it in Maybe I did take a step toward her because I felt Tookey s hand on my shoulder rough and warm And still how can I say it I yearned after her so dark and beautiful with that green poncho floating around her neck and shoulders as exotic and strange as to make you think of some beautiful woman from a Walter de la Mare poem Janey Lumley cried Janey He began to struggle through the snow toward her his arms outstretched No Tookey cried No Lumley He never even looked but she did She looked up at us and grinned And when she did I felt my longing my yearning turn to horror as cold as the grave as white and silent as bones in a shroud Even from the rise we could see the sullen red glare in those eyes They were less human than a wolf s eyes And when she grinned you could see how long her teeth had become She wasn t human anymore She was a dead thing somehow come back to life in this black howling storm Tookey made the sign of the cross at her She flinched back and then grinned at us again We were too far away and maybe too scared Stop it I whispered Can t we stop it Too late Booth Tookey says grimly Lumley had reached her He looked like a ghost himself coated in snow like he was He reached for her and then he began to scream I ll hear that sound in my dreams that man screaming like a child in a nightmare He tried to back away from her but her arms long and bare and as white as the snow snaked out and pulled him to her I could see her cock her head and then thrust it forward Booth Tookey said hoarsely We ve got to get out of here And so we ran Ran like rats I suppose some would say but those who would weren t there that night We fled back down along our own backtrail falling down getting up again slipping and sliding I kept looking back over my shoulder to see if that woman was coming after us grinning that grin and watching us with those red eyes We got back to the Scout and Tookey doubled over holding his chest Tookey I said badly scared What Ticker he said Been bad for five years or more Get me around in the shotgun seat Booth and then get us the hell out of here I hooked an arm under his coat and dragged him around and somehow boosted him up and in He leaned his head back and shut his eyes His skin was waxy-looking and yellow I went back around the hood of the truck at a trot and I damned near ran into the little girl She was just standing there beside the driver s-side door her hair in pigtails wearing nothing but a little bit of a yellow dress Mister she said in a high clear voice as sweet as morning mist won t you help me find my mother She s gone and I m so cold Honey I said honey you better get in the truck Your mother s I broke off and if there was ever a time in my life I was close to swooning that was the moment She was standing there you see but she was standing on top of the snow and there were no tracks not in any direction She looked up at me then Lumley s daughter Francie She was no more than seven years old and she was going to be seven for an eternity of nights Her little face was a ghastly corpse white her eyes a red and silver that you could fall into And below her jaw I could see two small punctures like pinpricks their edges horribly mangled She held out her arms at me and smiled Pick me up mister she said softly I want to give you a kiss Then you can take to my mommy I didn t want to but there was nothing I could do I was leaning forward my arms outstretched I could see her mouth opening I could see the little fangs inside the pink ring of her lips Something slipped down her chin bright and silvery and with a dim distant faraway horror I realized she was drooling Her small hands clasped themselves around my neck and I was thinking Well maybe it won t be so bad not so bad maybe it won t be so awful after a while when something black flew out of the Scout and struck her on the chest There was a puff of strange smelling smoke a flashing glow that was gone an instant later and then she was backing away hissing Her face was twisted into a vulpine mask of rage hate and pain She turned sideways and then and then she was gone One moment she was there and the next there was a twisting knot of snow that looked a little bit like a human shape Then the wind tattered it away across the fields Booth Tookey whispered Be quick now And I was But not so quick that I didn t have time to pick up what he had thrown at that little girl from hell His mother s Douay Bible That was some time ago I m a sight older now and I was no chicken then Herb Tooklander passed on two years ago He went peaceful in the night The bar is still there some man and his wife from Waterville bought it nice people and they ve kept it pretty much the same But I don t go by much It s different somehow with Tookey gone Things in the Lot go on pretty much as they always have The sheriff found that fellow Lumley s car the next day out of gas the battery dead Neither Tookey nor I said anything about it What would have been the point And every now and then a hitchhiker or a camper will disappear around there someplace up on Schoolyard Hill or out near the Harmony Hill cemetery They ll turn up the fellow s packsack or a paper-back book all swollen and bleached out by the rain or snow or some such But never the people I still have bad dreams about that stormy night we went out there Not about the woman so much as the little girl and the way she smiled when she held her arms up so I could pick her up So she could give me a kiss But I m an old man and the time comes soon when dreams are done You may have an occasion to be traveling in southern Maine yourself one of these days Pretty part of the countryside You may even stop by Tookey s Bar for a drink Nice place They kept the name just the same So have your drink and then my advice to you is to keep right on moving north Whatever you do don t go up that road to Jerusalem s Lot Especially not after dark There s a little girl somewhere out there And I think she s still waiting for her good night kiss THE WOMAN IN THE ROOM The question is Can he do it He doesn t know He knows that she chews them sometimes her face wrinkling at the awful orange taste and a sound comes from her mouth like splintering popsicle sticks But these are different pills gelatin capsules The box says darvon complex on the outside He found them in her medicine cabinet and turned them over in his hands thinking Something the doctor gave her before she had to go back to the hospital Something for the ticking nights The medicine cabinet is full of remedies neatly lined up like a voodoo doctor s cures Gris-gris of the Western world fleet suppositories He has never used a suppository in his life and the thought of putting a waxy something in his rectum to soften by body heat makes him feel ill There is no dignity in putting things up your ass Phillips milk of magnesia anacin arthritis pain formula pepto-bismol More He can trace the course of her illness through the medicines But these pills are different They are like regular Darvon only in that they are gray gelatin capsules But they are bigger what his dead father used to call hosscock pills The box says Asp gr Darvon gr and could she chew them even if he was to give them to her Would she The house is still running the refrigerator runs and shuts off the furnace kicks in and out every now and then the cuckoo bird pokes grumpily out of the clock to announce an hour or a half He supposes that after she dies it will fall to Kevin and him to break up housekeeping She s gone all right The whole house says so She is in the Central Maine Hospital in Lewiston Room She went when the pain got so bad she could no longer go out to the kitchen and make her own coffee At times when he visited she cried without knowing it The elevator creaks going up and he finds himself examining the blue elevator certificate The certificate makes it clear that the elevator is safe creaks or no creaks She has been here for nearly three weeks now and today they gave her an operation called a cortotomy He is not sure if that is how it s spelled but that is how it sounds The doctor has told her that the cortotomy involves sticking a needle into her neck and then into her brain The doctor has told her that this is like sticking a pin into an orange and spearing a seed When the needle has poked into her pain center a radio signal will be sent down to the tip of the needle and the pain center will be blown out Like unplugging a TV Then the cancer in her belly will stop being such a nuisance The thought of this operation makes him even more uneasy than the thought of suppositories melting warmly in his anus It makes him think of a book by Michael Crichton called The Terminal Man which deals with putting wires in people s heads According to Crichton this can be a very bad scene You better believe it The elevator door opens on the third floor and he steps out This is the old wing of the hospital and it smells like the sweet-smelling sawdust they sprinkle over puke at a county fair He has left the pills in the glove compartment of his car He has not had anything to drink before this visit The walls up here are two-tone brown on the bottom and white on top He thinks that the only two-tone combination in the whole world that might be more depressing than brown and white would be pink and black Hospital corridors like giant Good n Plentys The thought makes him smile and feel nauseated at the same time Two corridors meet in a T in front of the elevator and there is a drinking fountain where he always stops to put things off a little There are pieces of hospital equipment here and there like strange playground toys A litter with chrome sides and rubber wheels the sort of thing they use to wheel you up to the OR when they are ready to give you your cortotomy There is a large circular object whose function is unknown to him It looks like the wheels you sometimes see in squirrel cages There is a rolling IV tray with two bottles hung from it like a Salvador Dali dream of tits Down one of the two corridors is the nurses station and laughter fueled by coffee drifts out to him He gets his drink and then saunters down toward her room He is scared of what he may find and hopes she will be sleeping If she is he will not wake her up Above the door of every room there is a small square light When a patient pushes his call button this light goes on glowing red Up and down the hall patients are walking slowly wearing cheap hospital robes over their hospital underwear The robes have blue and white pinstripes and round collars The hospital underwear is called a johnny The johnnies look all right on the women but decidedly strange on the men because they are like knee-length dresses or slips The men always seem to wear brown imitation-leather slippers on their feet The women favor knitted slippers with balls of yarn on them His mother has a pair of these and calls them mules The patients remind him of a horror movie called The Night of the Living Dead They all walk slowly as if someone had unscrewed the tops of their organs like mayonnaise jars and liquids were sloshing around inside Some of them use canes Their slow gait as they promenade up and down the halls is frightening but also dignified It is the walk of people who are going nowhere slowly the walk of college students in caps and gowns filing into a convocation hall Ectoplasmic music drifts everywhere from transistor radios Voices babble He can hear Black Oak Arkansas singing Jim Dandy Go Jim Dandy go Jim Dandy a falsetto voice screams merrily at the slow hall walkers He can hear a talk-show host discussing Nixon in tones that have been dipped in acid like smoking quills He can hear a polka with French lyrics Lewiston is still a French-speaking town and they love their jigs and reels almost as much as they love to cut each other in the bars on lower Lisbon Street He pauses outside his mother s room and for a while there he was freaked enough to come drunk It made him ashamed to be drunk in front of his mother even though she was too doped and full of Elavil to know Elavil is a tranquilizer they give to cancer patients so it won t bother them so much that they re dying The way he worked it was to buy two six-packs of Black Label beer at Sonny s Market in the afternoon He would sit with the kids and watch their afternoon programs on TV Three beers with Sesame Street two beers during Mister Rogers one beer during Electric Company Then one with supper He took the other five beers in the car It was a twenty-two-mile drive from Raymond to Lewiston via Routes and and it was possible to be pretty well in the bag by the time he got to the hospital with one or two beers left over He would bring things for his mother and leave them in the car so there would be an excuse to go back and get them and also drink another half beer and keep the high going It also gave him an excuse to piss outdoors and somehow that was the best of the whole miserable business He always parked in the side lot which was rutted frozen November dirt and the cold night air assured full bladder contraction Pissing in one of the hospital bathrooms was too much like an apotheosis of the whole hospital experience the nurse s call button beside the hopper the chrome handle bolted at a degree angle the bottle of pink disinfectant over the sink Bad news You better believe it The urge to drink going home was nil So leftover beers collected in the icebox at home and when there were six of them he would never have come if he had known it was going to be this bad The first thought that crosses his mind is She s no orange and the second thought is She s really dying quick now as if she had a train to catch out there in nullity She is straining in the bed not moving except for her eyes but straining inside her body something is moving in there Her neck has been smeared orange with stuff that looks like Mercurochrome and there is a bandage below her left ear where some humming doctor put the radio needle in and blew out per cent of her motor controls along with the pain center Her eyes follow him like the eyes of a paint-by-the-numbers Jesus I don t think you better see me tonight Johnny I m not so good Maybe I ll be better tomorrow What is it It itches I itch all over Are my legs together He can t see if her legs are together They are just a raised V under the ribbed hospital sheet It s very hot in the room No one is in the other bed right now He thinks Roommates come and roommates go but my mom stays on forever Christ They re together Mom Move them down can you Johnny Then you better go I ve never been in a fix like this before I can t move anything My nose itches Isn t that a pitiful way to be with your nose itching and not able to scratch it He scratches her nose and then takes hold of her calves through the sheet and pulls them down He can put one hand around both calves with no trouble at all although his hands are not particularly large She groans Tears are running down her cheeks to her ears Momma Can you move my legs down I just did Oh That s all right then I think I m crying I don t mean to cry in front of you I wish I was out of this I d do anything to be out of this Would you like a smoke Could you get me a drink of water first Johnny I m as dry as an old chip Sure He takes her glass with a flexible straw in it out and around the corner to the drinking fountain A fat man with an elastic bandage on one leg is sailing slowly down the corridor He isn t wearing one of the pinstriped robes and is holding his johnny closed behind him He fills the glass from the fountain and goes back to Room with it She has stopped crying Her lips grip the straw in a way that reminds him of camels he has seen in travelogues Her face is scrawny His most vivid memory of her in the life he lived as her son is of a time when he was twelve He and his brother Kevin and this woman had moved to Maine so that she could take care of her parents Her mother was old and bedridden High blood pressure had made his grandmother senile and to add insult to injury had struck her blind Happy eighty-sixth birthday Here s one to grow on And she lay in a bed all day long blind and senile wearing large diapers and rubber pants unable to remember what breakfast had been but able to recite all the Presidents right up to Ike And so the three generations of them had lived together in that house where he had so recently found the pills although both grandparents are now long since dead and at twelve he had been lipping off about something at the breakfast table he doesn t remember what but something and his mother had been washing out her mother s pissy diapers and then mnning them through the wringer of her ancient washing machine and she had turned around and laid into him with one of them and the first snap of the wet heavy diaper had upset his bowl of Special K and sent it spinning wildly across the table like a large blue tiddlywink and the second blow had stropped his back not hurting but stunning the smart talk out of his mouth and the woman now lying shrunken in this bed in this room had whopped him again and again saying You keep your big mouth shut theres nothing big about you right now but your mouth and so you keep it shut until the rest of you grows the same size and each italicized word was accompanied by a strop of his grandmother s wet diaper WHACKO and any other smart things he might have had to say just evaporated There was not a chance in the world for smart talk He had discovered on that day and for all time that there is nothing in the world so perfect to set a twelve-year-old s impression of his place in the scheme of things into proper perspective as being beaten across the back with a wet grandmother-diaper It had taken four years after that day to relearn the art of smarting off She chokes on the water a little and it frightens him even though he has been thinking about giving her pills He asks her again if she would like a cigarette and she says If it s not any trouble Then you better go Maybe I ll be better tomorrow He shakes a Kool out of one of the packages scattered on the table by her bed and lights it He holds it between the first and second fingers of his right hand and she puffs it her lips stretching to grasp the filter Her inhale is weak The smoke drifts from her lips I had to live sixty years so my son could hold my cigarettes for me I don t mind She puffs again and holds the filter against her lips so long that he glances away from it to her eyes and sees they are closed Mom The eyes open a little vaguely Johnny Right How long have you been here Not long I think I better go Let you sleep Hnnnnn He snuffs the cigarette in her ashtray and slinks from the room thinking I want to talk to that doctor Goddamn it I want to talk to the doctor who did that Getting into the elevator he thinks that the word doctor becomes a synonym for man after a certain degree of proficiency in the trade has been reached as if it was an expected provisioned thing that doctors must be cruel and thus attain a special degree of humanity But I don t think she can really go on much longer he tells his brother later that night His brother lives in Andover seventy miles west He only gets to the hospital once or twice a week But is her pain better Kev asks She says she itches He has the pills in his sweater pocket His wife is safely asleep He takes them out stolen loot from his mother s empty house where they all once lived with the grandparents He turns the box over and over in his hand as he talks like a rabbit s foot Well then she s better For Kev everything is always better as if life moved toward some sublime vertex It is a view the younger brother does not share She s paralyzed Does it matter at this point Of course it matters he bursts out thinking of her legs under the white ribbed sheet John she s dying She s not dead yet This in fact is what horrifies him The conversation will go around in circles from here the profits accruing to the telephone company but this is the nub Not dead yet Just lying in that room with a hospital tag on her wrist listening to phantom radios up and down the hall And she s going to have to come to grips with time the doctor says He is a big man with a red sandy beard He stands maybe six foot four and his shoulders are heroic The doctor led him tactfully out into the hall when she began to nod off The doctor continues You see some motor impairment is almost unavoidable in an operation like the cortotomy Your mother has some movement in the left hand now She may reasonably expect to recover her right hand in two to four weeks Will she walk The doctor looks at the drilled-cork ceiling of the corridor judiciously His beard crawls all the way down to the collar of his plaid shirt and for some ridiculous reason Johnny thinks of Algernon Swinburne why he could not say This man is the opposite of poor Swinburne in every way I should say not She s lost too much ground She s going to be bedridden for the rest of her life I think that s a fair assumption yes He begins to feel some admiration for this man who he hoped would be safely hateful Disgust follows the feeling must he accord admiration for the simple truth How long can she live like that It s hard to say That s more like it The tumor is blocking one of her kidneys now The other one is operating fine When the tumor blocks it she ll go to sleep A uremic coma Yes the doctor says but a little more cautiously Uremia is a techno-pathological term usually the property of doctors and medical examiners alone But Johnny knows it because his grandmother died of the same thing although there was no cancer involved Her kidneys simply packed it in and she died floating in internal piss up to her ribcage She died in bed at home at dinnertime Johnny was the one who first suspected she was truly dead this time and not just sleeping in the comatose open-mouthed way that old people have Two small tears had squeezed out of her eyes Her old toothless mouth was drawn in reminding him of a tomato that has been hollowed out perhaps to hold egg salad and then left forgotten on the kitchen shelf for a stretch of days He held a round cosmetic mirror to her mouth for a minute and when the glass did not fog and hide the image of her tomato mouth he called for his mother All of that had seemed as right as this did wrong She says she still has pain And that she itches The doctor taps his head solemnly like Victor DeGroot in the old psychiatrist cartoons She imagines the pain But it is nonetheless real Real to her That is why time is so important Your mother can no longer count time in terms of seconds and minutes and hours She must restructure those units into days and weeks and months He realizes what this burly man with the beard is saying and it boggles him A bell dings softly He cannot talk more to this man He is a technical man He talks smoothly of time as though he has gripped the concept as easily as a fishing rod Perhaps he has Can you do anything more for her Very little But his manner is serene as if this were right He is after all not offering false hope Can it be worse than a coma Of course it can We can t chart these things with any real degree of accuracy It s like having a shark loose in your body She may bloat Bloat Her abdomen may swell and then go down and then swell again But why dwell on such things now I believe we can safely say that they would do the job but suppose they don t Or suppose they catch me I don t want to go to court on a mercy-killing charge Not even if I can beat it I have no causes to grind He thinks of newspaper headlines screaming matricide and grimaces Sitting in the parking lot he turns the box over and over in his hands darvon complex The question still is Can he do it Should he She has said I wish I were out of this I d do anything to be out of this Kevin is talking of fixing her a room at his house so she won t die in the hospital The hospital wants her out They gave her some new pills and she went on a raving bummer That was four days after the cortotomy They d like her someplace else because no one has perfected a really fool-proof cancerectomy yet And at this point if they got it all out of her she d be left with nothing but her legs and her head He has been thinking of how time must be for her like something that has gotten out of control like a sewing basket full of threaded spools spilled all over the floor for a big mean tomcat to play with The days in Room The night in Room They have run a string from the call button and tied it to her left index finger because she can no longer move her hand far enough to press the button if she thinks she needs the bedpan It doesn t matter too much anyway because she can t feel the pressure down there her midsection might as well be a sawdust pile She moves her bowels in the bed and pees in the bed and only knows when she smells it She is down to ninety-five pounds from one- fifty and her body s muscles are so unstrung that it s only a loose bag tied to her brain like a child s sack puppet Would it be any different at Kev s Can he do murder He knows it is murder The worst kind matricide as if he were a sentient fetus in an early Ray Bradbury horror story determined to turn the tables and abort the animal that has given it life Perhaps it is his fault anyway He is the only child to have been nurtured inside her a change-of-life baby His brother was adopted when another smiling doctor told her she would never have any children of her own And of course the cancer now in her began in the womb like a second child his own darker twin His life and her death began in the same place Should he not do what the other is doing already so slowly and clumsily He has been giving her aspirin on the sly for the pain she imagines she has She has them in a Sucrets box in her hospital-table drawer along with her get-well cards and her reading glasses that no longer work They have taken away her dentures because they are afraid she might pull them down her throat and choke on them so now she simply sucks the aspirin until her tongue is slightly white Surely he could give her the pills three or four would be enough Fourteen hundred grains of aspirin and four hundred grains of Darvon administered to a woman whose body weight has dropped per cent over five months No one knows he has the pills not Kevin not his wife He thinks that maybe they ve put someone else in Room s other bed and he won t have to worry about it He can cop out safely He wonders if that wouldn t be best really If there is another woman in the room his options will be gone and he can regard the fact as a nod from Providence He thinks You re looking better tonight Am I Sure How do you feel Oh not so good Not so good tonight Let s see you move your right hand She raises it off the counterpane It floats splay-fingered in front of her eyes for a moment then drops Thump He smiles and she smiles back He asks her Did you see the doctor today Yes he came in He s good to come every day Will you give me a little water John He gives her some water from the flexible straw You re good to come as often as you do John You re a good son She s crying again The other bed is empty accusingly so Every now and then one of the blue and white pinstriped bath-robes sails by them up the hall The door stands open halfway He takes the water gently away from her thinking idiotically Is this glass half empty or half full How s your left hand Oh pretty good Let s see She raises it It has always been her smart hand and perhaps that is why it has recovered as well as it has from the devastating effects of the cortotomy She clenches it Flexes it Snaps the fingers weakly Then it falls back to the counterpane Thump She complains But there s no feeling in it Let me see something He goes to her wardrobe opens it and reaches behind the coat she came to the hospital in to get at her purse She keeps it in here because she is paranoid about robbers she has heard that some of the orderlies are rip-off artists who will lift anything they can get their hands on She has heard from one of her roommates who has since gone home that a woman in the new wing lost five hundred dollars which she kept in her shoe His mother is paranoid about a great many things lately and has once told him a man sometimes hides under her bed in the late-at-night Part of it is the combination of drugs they are trying on her They make the bennies he occasionally dropped in college look like Excedrin You can have your pick from the locked drug cabinet at the end of the corridor just past the nurses station ups and downs highs and bummers Death maybe merciful death like a sweet black blanket The wonders of modern science He takes the purse back to her bed and opens it Can you take something out of here Oh Johnny I don t know He says persuasively Try it For me The left hand rises from the counterpane like a crippled helicopter It cruises Dives Comes out of the purse with a single wrinkled Kleenex He applauds Good Good But she turns her face away Last year I was able to pull two full dish trucks with these hands If there s to be a time it s now It is very hot in the room but the sweat on his forehead is cold He thinks If she doesn t ask for aspirin I won t Not tonight And he knows if it isn t tonight it s never Okay Her eyes flick to the half-open door slyly Can you sneak me a couple of my pills Johnny It is how she always asks She is not supposed to have any pills outside of her regular medication because she has lost so much body weight and she has built up what his druggie friends of his college days would have called a heavy thing The body s immunity stretches to within a fingernail s breadth of lethal dosage One more pill and you re over the edge They say it is what happened to Marilyn Monroe I brought some pills from home Did you They re good for pain He holds the box out to her She can only read very close She frowns over the large print and then says I had some of that Darvon stuff before It didn t help me This is stronger Her eyes rise from the box to his own Idly she says Is it He can only smile foolishly He cannot speak It is like the first time he got laid it happened in the back of some friend s car and when he came home his mother asked him if he had a good time and he could only smile this same foolish smile Can I chew them I don t know You could try one All right Don t let them see He opens the box and pries the plastic lid off the bottle He pulls the cotton out of the neck Could she do all that with the crippled helicopter of her left hand Would they believe it He doesn t know Maybe they don t either Maybe they wouldn t even care He shakes six of the pills into his hand He watches her watching him It is many too many even she must know that If she says anything about it he will put them all back and offer her a single Arthritis Pain Formula A nurse glides by outside and his hand twitches clicking the gray capsules together but the nurse doesn t look in to see how the cortotomy kid is doing His mother doesn t say anything only looks at the pills like they were perfectly ordinary pills if there is such a thing But on the other hand she has never liked ceremony she would not crack a bottle of champagne on her own boat Here you go he says in a perfectly natural voice and pops the first one into her mouth She gums it reflectively until the gelatin dissolves and then she winces Taste bad I won t No not too bad He gives her another And another She chews them with that same reflective look He gives her a fourth She smiles at him and he sees with horror that her tongue is yellow Maybe if he hits her in the belly she will bring them up But he can t He could never hit his mother Will you see if my legs are together Just take these first He gives her a fifth And a sixth Then he sees if her legs are together They are She says I think I ll sleep a little now All right I m going to get a drink You ve always been a good son Johnny He puts the bottle in the box and tucks the box into her purse leaving the plastic top on the sheet beside her He leaves the open purse beside her and thinks She asked for her purse I brought it to her and opened it just before I left She said she could get what she wanted out of it She said she d get the nurse to put it back in the wardrobe He goes out and gets his drink There is a mirror over the fountain and he runs out his tongue and looks at it When he goes back into the room she is sleeping with her hands pressed together The veins in them are big rambling He gives her a kiss and her eyes roll behind their lids but do not open Yes He feels no different either good or bad He starts out of the room and thinks of something else He goes back to her side takes the bottle out of the box and rubs it all over his shirt Then he presses the limp fingertips of her sleeping left hand on the bottle Then he puts it back and goes out of the room quickly without looking back He goes home and waits for the phone to ring and wishes he had given her another kiss While he waits he watches TV and drinks a lot of water BY STEPHEN KING NOVELS AS RICHARD BACHMAN Carrie Range Salem s Lot The Long Walk The Shining Roadwork The Stand The Running man The
